No longer are you forced to break the grass in your way to hit your target. Additionally Cut Through is extremly efficient with a negligible amount of additional calculations over vanilla compared to similar mods and works great with many other mods that rely on Minecraft's hit target implementation.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/media.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/media/1.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/installation.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">INSTALLATION REQUIRED ON CLIENT &amp; REQUIRED ON SERVER</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzles-lib\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">PUZZLES LIB</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FABRIC &amp; NEOFORGE &amp; FORGE)</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">FABRIC API</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FABRIC)</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">⏩ </span></strong><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">REQUIRES </span></strong><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port\"><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">FORGE CONFIG API PORT</span></strong></a><strong><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> TO BE INSTALLED (FABRIC &amp; FORGE)</span></strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/data/cutthrough/strip.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fuzss/modresources/main/pages/commons/headers/configuration.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"32\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Configuration is easily possible directly from in-game using the mod menu (requires </span><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Mod Menu</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> by </span><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/user/Prospector\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Prospector</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> to be installed on Fabric) by installing </span><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Forge Config Screens</span></a><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For manual configuration using an external text editor all files are found at </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">.minecraft/config</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, named as </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-client.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-common.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">, or </span><code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">MOD_ID-server.toml</span></code><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"> depending on the type of config.

It boasts great compatibility with the wider mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is available for multiple mod loaders, but we recommend using [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) for the most simple and lightweight experience. If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed your mod loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-10-27T23:15:05.225688Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":24051853,"followers":17719,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1","1.21.2","1.21.3"],"loaders":["fabric","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d","qhg37WBD","dNHeFokL","QHGZ9XSU","dEpHs0Hg","ygf8cVZg","OwLQelEI","RncWhTxD","rcNehRIZ","oZOSEhyy","vO5IVg3V","CcIWi5Av","YWD36TtF","yExcQU0x","r0Cvb6jf","zJZY6GYO","bSL0wBSW","HCEjRjK4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/295862f4724dc3f78df3447ad6072b2dcd3ef0c9_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"ygf8cVZg","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"DzLrfrbK","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.11","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.5.11","changelog":"This is a minor release of Sodium, further fixing driver checks, adding minor fixes for fluid rendering, and fixing a crash when using specific resource packs that changed the clouds texture.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-29T13:43:41.842195Z","downloads":1500797,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c4293c1483f3b39c1c6c4c69143e8bb2c6e53daf","sha512":"628129702e830fe88d79f0b87ef0591b708fb39045ce3d985703d6a3a78c30c9beb518df8e70151e55ca6c82d9274fea904c016f60085d889a4f7ac431cccd9e"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/versions/ygf8cVZg/sodium-fabric-0.5.11%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"sodium-fabric-0.5.11+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":968419,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4reLOAKe","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TEZXhE2U/f4705a5f2388c65029ae2e59f1434b3e6e4de23a.png","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"4reLOAKe","user":{"id":"DzLrfrbK","username":"IMS","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/31803019?v=4","bio":"the Iris guy","created":"2020-12-01T00:40:02.137876Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sodium-fabric-0.5.11+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods/chiseled-enchanting-0.1.6+1.20.jar":{"sha512":"948af79aaca3975d8072ad78e9e73d92da5b0eea2304cb7763ead2e7c3e50f4ad3314fd9c0300b560fe59a6041d1e20272b939acb8c0545a66a30b49dbb955bf","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"K23fxwUX","slug":"chiseled-enchanting","project_type":"mod","team":"Nfc2e26t","title":"Chiseled Enchanting","description":"Enchanted books in chiseled bookshelves are added to the enchanting table","body":"This mod allows you to use enchanted books in chiseled bookshelves around an enchanting table to make that enchanting table inherit the books' enchantments.\n\nThis allows you to get Swift Sneak, Mending, Wind Burst, and Soul Speed from an enchanting table without having to loot dozens of structures multiple times or, for Mending, buy it from villagers.\n\nYou still need to find the structures to get the book for the chiseled bookshelf, but once you get it, you have already explored the structure, so you have the right to enchant as many items as you want with it. It is like armor trims, but for enchantments.\n\n## Example\nLet's say you have a Swift Sneak III book which you got after raiding an ancient city:\n\n![A Swift Sneak III book](https://github.com/Pedro270707/chiseled-enchanting/blob/1.21/enchanted_book.png?raw=true)\n\nYou want to enchant two leggings: one without Thorns and one with Thorns. But you only have one book, so normally, you would have to find another ancient city to get the book again. You have already been through the adventure once, so there will be nothing new the second time around. With this mod, you can just place it in a chiseled bookshelf near the enchanting table:\n\n![The Swift Sneak III book in a chiseled bookshelf near an enchanting table](https://github.com/Pedro270707/chiseled-enchanting/blob/1.21/book_in_chiseled_bookshelf.png?raw=true)\n\nAfter you have added it to the chiseled bookshelf, it may come in the enchanting table if the item accepts it:\n\n![The Swift Sneak enchantment on level 30](https://github.com/Pedro270707/chiseled-enchanting/blob/1.21/enchanting_table.png?raw=true)\n\nAs you can see, I got Swift Sneak III.

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-10-16T16:33:06.343169Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":14575614,"followers":11764,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF","g2qXxjsR","fsK2ycFx","OC4JOVBe","my7uONjU","p25IJhj0","5a3sPIH2","NTZCh7rb","5szYtenV","M7RXiitG","9x0igjLz","2mbrKlX3","BrMIoIMv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/bcc8686c13af0143adf4285d741256af824f70b7_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.11.2","version_number":"mc1.20.1-0.11.2","changelog":"Lithium 0.11.2 for Minecraft 1.20.1 is the same as the previous release, just for 1.20.1 instead of 1.20.\n\nYou can check out all configuration options [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/blob/mc1.20.1-0.11.2/lithium-mixin-config.md).\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-12T23:58:59.682048Z","downloads":5490609,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8f4642147e60827f728badac7a819d1a9f3b25d5","sha512":"d1b5c90ba8b4879814df7fbf6e67412febbb2870e8131858c211130e9b5546e86b213b768b912fc7a2efa37831ad91caf28d6d71ba972274618ffd59937e5d0d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/versions/ZSNsJrPI/lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","filename":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar","primary":true,"size":645865,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"uhPSqlnd","username":"2No2Name","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/50278648?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-31T09:13:58.517719Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Maintainer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"peSx5UYg","user":{"id":"TEZXhE2U","username":"jellysquid3","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/TEZXhE2U/f4705a5f2388c65029ae2e59f1434b3e6e4de23a.png","bio":"Professional idiot at day, maniac programmer by night.","created":"2021-01-03T00:49:18.373336Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lithium-fabric-mc1.20.1-0.11.2.jar"},"mods/create_jetpack_curios-1.0.0-fabric-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"4005c69625a2641d5c6e2e7fe345b39528ddd4c56c5e6bb7d19c61ed8e073b1207eda2a731f9748fe4723505040d3fb89ffb877f49d11ba29ab467577539ecc9","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"BBhCMftF","slug":"create-curios-jetpack","project_type":"mod","team":"PAY3CgRR","title":"Create: Curios Jetpack [Forge/Fabric]","description":"Use Create jetpack and backtanks in Curios/Trinkets back slot.","body":"<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/NKSy3JP/banner5.png\" width=\"1125\" height=\"422\" /></p>\n<h2>About</h2>\n<p>This mod adds Curios (or Trinkets) compatibility for <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/create-jetpack\">Create Jetpack</a>, allowing you to equip both your jetpack and chestplate simultaneously.

The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.\n\n### Dependencies (v3.11+)\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Better Statistics Screen](#) | Optional | Optional |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n| [TCDCommons API](https://modrinth.com/mod/Eldc1g37) | Required as of `1.21` | Required as of `1.21` |\n| [Roughly Enough Items (REI)](https://modrinth.com/mod/nfn13YXA) | Optional | Not needed |\n| [Mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mOgUt4GM) | Optional | Not needed |\n\n### Some QnA\n- What about Minecraft Forge?\n    - I have no plans on making future ports to Forge or any other mod loaders. The code-bases are vastly different and such a port would cost a large amount of time and effort. See [GitHub Issue #100](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/issues/100) for more info. However, not all hope is lost! [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/u58R1TMW) is a mod that lets people run Fabric mods on Forge! Please check it out. Also keep in mind the mod is in beta (as of me writing this), so please don't be harsh towards the mod's developers while expecting the mod to work 100% of the time.\n- Port to older Minecraft versions?\n    - Nope. Same reason as the 'Minecraft Forge' one.\n- I can't pin stats to the hud. I right-click them, but REI shows up instead. How do I pin stats?\n    - Hold down the left shift button while right clicking a stat. That is, if you have REI installed.\n- For mobs and items, I am only able to pin one stat type. How do I pin for example \"times used/mined/crafted\" and so on?\n    - Once you pin an item or a mob stat to the HUD, you may right-click the pinned entry to configure it. There you will find the option to switch the stat type.\n- I wanna see another player's statistics, but the server's telling me it couldn't find that player, even though they are online.\n    - Please double-check the player name caplitalization. If the capitalization is correct, then make sure the other player also has this mod installed. Then, make sure the other player has enabled \"Allow stats sharing\" in their BSS mod settings/config.\n\n## Features\nThis mod aims to improve on the existing features, as well as add additional features that may futher be helpful in tracking and managing one's statistics.  \n  \nNote that any optional features that this mod adds to the game, such as the \"/statistics\" command and the \"Stat announcement system\", may be disabled in the config or though the in-game mod settings menu.\n\n### The `/statistics` command\n**Alt command:** `/stats`  \nThis is an optional feature that adds a command that allows people (with sufficient permission levels, such as OP) to manage and view player statistics through commands. This feature may also be useful for writing datapacks that may wanna read as well as manage player statistics.  \n\n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*\n\n**The command syntax is the following:**\n- `/statistics clear <targets>`\n- `/statistics edit <targets> <stat_type> <stat> (set|increase) <value>`\n- [ex. general stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:custom minecraft:jump set 123`\n- [ex. item stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:used minecraft:wooden_shovel set 123`\n- [ex. mob stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:killed minecraft:zombie set 123`\n\n### The \"Stat announcement system\"\nThis is an optional server-sided feature that broadcasts special messages when players do certain things or achieve certain stats or \"milestones\". As of `v3.9.7`, the SAS announces when players achieve certain stats for the first time, such as for example \"Mining their first diamond\", or \"Crafting their first item of a specific type\", and so on..  \n  \n*Note: Can be disabled in the config.*  \n  \n![The SAS in action](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/assets/66475965/3467ecae-5393-4fa9-9bf3-5146cc07f7b7)\n\n### The \"General\" statistics tab\nThis tab does not add nor show anything special regarding general statistics other than the redesigned UI layout. The filters menu features a way for you to hide all general statistics that are currently set to '0', as well as a search bar that will help you look for a specific statistic.  \n  \n![General statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/f612dcb73d9e4ffc4ca0494559a31221396c2435.png)\n\n### The \"Items\" statistics tab\nThe items tab displays items in a visual grid of items, similar to how an inventory screen does it. The items are categorized in item groups, just like they would be in the creative inventory menu. All items you interacted with are shown in this tab. This will hopefully help you find the items you are looking for easier. The search field in the filters menu can be used to look for specific items. To see a statistic for an item, place your cursor over the said item, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard, and a tooltip text will display the statistics. The \"Show item names\" checkbox defines whether or not the tooltip will also show the item name.  \n  \n![Item statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5ef05e79400d4e0d386f899dc1849f72731c0372.png)\n\n### The \"Mobs\" statistics tab\nSimilar to the \"Items\" tab, the \"Mobs\" tab will also show mobs in a grid. The mobs are visually rendered on the GUI screen, so it is easier for you to find the mob you are looking for, and because it looks nicer. Just like with the items tab, to see the statistics for a given mob, place your cursor over the said mob, or use \"Tab\" to navigate to it using your keyboard. A tooltip text will show you the statistics.  \n  \n*Note that due to technical limitations in my programming, some mobs may fail to render properly, and some mobs may even appear as \"plain text\" instead of their 3D model due to errors in my rendering method.*  \n  \n![Mob statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd6c360face8ba7fcf05224a08044614c7eb9496.png)\n\n### The \"Food & drinks\" statistics tab (formerly \"A balanced diet\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"A balanced died\" advancement. It does that by displaying all food items in grouped grids, similarly to how the \"Items\" tab does it. This tab will show you all food items, even the ones you haven't interacted with, and will also highlight the foods you already ate before, helping you identify which foods you need to eat next to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that this tab may not precisely tell you exactly which foods you do and do not need, as that kind of criteria is controlled \"server-side\", and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all foods are shown instead.*  \n\n![Food & drinks statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/9e3478d0573276349e9842337de3cf598dcf75db.png)\n\n### The \"Hostile creatures\" statistics tab (formerly \"Monsters Hunted\")\nThis tab aims to help you achieve the \"Monsters hunted\" advancement. It shows you a grid of mobs similarly to the \"Mobs\" tab, except the mobs shown on this tab are hostile creatures you have either killed or are yet to kill. Similarly to the \"Food & drinks\" tab, any mobs you have killed will be highlighted in this tab, helping you easily see which mobs you need to kill next in order to earn the advancement.  \n  \n*Note that just like with \"Food & drinks\", the criteria for getting the advancement is controlled server-side, and may be modified by other mods and data-packs. As such, all hostile creatures are always shown.*  \n\n![Hostile creatures statistics tab](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fe98cfce86319282774228f4f4c81748eaa00139.png)\n\n### In-game config menu\nA menu that lets you configure the mod in-game. Nothing more or less.  \n\n![In-game config menu](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/7413856bcf4e799b7e265bcf732f17cbb1e2e7c2.png)\n\n### MCBS files\nThis is an additional feature that aims to let people save a \"snapshot\" of their current statistics, into a file, which can then be opened later or shared with other players.  \n  \n*Note that opening an MCBS file does not \"override\" you current stats, as it only shows you what your stats looked like at the time you saved the MCBS file.*\n\n![Saving a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/315ca6da7dcb943b3435c6a11917393786ae4367.png)\n![Opening a file](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/5f1855efceb8870339456bb1d3e8235d795f3cfe.png)\n\n### The statistics hud\nThis is another additional feature that allows you to \"pin\" any stat to the \"in-game-hud\", where you can then look at any statistic of your choosing as you play the game. To pin a stat, simply right-click it with your mouse (hold down shift as well if you have REI installed).  \n\n*Note that due to technical limitations, pinned statistics update occasionally by default, and will not update \"live\" unless this mod is installed on the server-side as well and the \"live stat updates\" is enabled on the client-side.*  \n\n![Pinning stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/3c7e15962f4c8a2268bc5da9a2e7d97ae7850fb6.png)\n![Configuring pinned stats](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/681f25b72304d0fdde71ab3104d51fab506c3c34.png)\n![What pinned stats look like during gameplay](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/images/fd7f29e99ed6b73981b2e2cbcdb4eddb93a2bbcb.png)\n\n## Credits\nThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and helped translate the mod to other languages! And a special thank **you**, the person reading this, for choosing to use this mod! (Well, thank you even if you're just checking out the mod and not actually using it. That also means a lot!)\n\n### The showcase YouTube video I recorded\nI decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.\n\n### The screenshots I took\nResource packs and shader packs used at the time of screenshotting.\n- [Complementary shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/)\n- [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/5aPp18Lx)\n- [3D crops Revamped](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/PgpTtNoI)\n- [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/6SLU7tS5)\n\nSorry if I missed any. I had too many of them applied at once.","published":"2022-09-02T19:38:08.030776Z","updated":"2024-10-25T10:42:04.621515Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3129809,"followers":1877,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w13a","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1","1.21.2","1.21.3"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["EnelgdHp","Fk8W9xAv","8RhZhQYw","94aapoJA","4rdXgAx2","uLo8KWrK","SoYOLyoj","WEev32xa","fvo5X8Xj","9eNc6jlA","SAGXYRQW","qgsvDAFG","gz1quzFI","1dR0gD57","307623Pb","F7rjMuqu","WajeE658","H4ve3iC9","oKip6o69","fbwYDHTx","PuyUL15E","wcdeU0Uk","c02NBGoz","YwgivtRx","aMHvwPf2","W7pDuGqC","E1EeTCzR","OFa15O41","QNNqgAdx","nJhfzkvB","GH2n9Xmp","z12xxYRe","823VmOAv","Ufs79Xwx","AKglt1TW","NwsPvqFn","JCedcydw","ytM62cvx","M5IJOqMW","s8PMW1n2","HMC7jXEQ","RM7Dy7vu","9PPcvO4i","UrwGLSJI","LBO8kIEp","DA4J8QTI","zuI0rtcT","oCC1YLFI","5rMFdCwJ","tGhUGisK","sb3SaBaE","QZwSwiZR","18RwTRug","vsM2NrtL","jRrE1yaP","fVJ0IIJU","yebgi9T4","w3dUagqG","8Yswy53a","h7aGFS6n","A6kv9M3f","ng46cYL0","SbiaYJpr","ODcKksFu","cTVirG90","APEn5ML0","eGcQh6sR","VXZAyG4G","dx8kubiy","OQQwqPed","77XYVAe5","5bD14l3I","pQEGz8q4","JwLjCwiB","9Nle6p3Y","XWYy9iPd","saxPMWUK","WNvtlvrR","UPxGVo2j","HZMdcy1s","flzNW6MC","rTAZet3B","S8zvr548","Ah2PN5Vd","TcpdjZq3","TJVb61wk","IRAj3Zja","rCdw3Yao","RanY7iKp","I0YaiUKC","5RoB9ulm","itZVnHEf","yLNRroby","LiBg6GMi","3Dz7ZYBA","WLBCUkWu","uxQfDyI7","UivJDox9","e3q6lD9z","zrhRDvws","rGCv0cOY","qZJRvw7w","1weQYuP0","LyAkMd7b","CdN82lOX","qGf3pduz","KOUA7KHm","E5zqzlew","hsjPjr1l","eZ6vxjVH","CTYD1jrY","hsA6tx3U","2d67uRLI","lwRehylW","9mc9uiOb","PoHesack","qdiBvpLD","cxqQA00g","nRGVPeao","sogTh4cI","cJbr3hAU","KWuKt0ct","1LjgPqG5","71Ie3Fad","25Kl4Bo0","RP77Jp7s","bGYkCuJ4","v5KSPfZS","j9GJlHWA","wyQ2nH56","tEseitwF","N1acUGhP","u3oGwdmM","u5ABQXZg","vnJYWJ44","4lGy0aaq","LsbNVGUA","7E0ghj2a","NNrDcObC","7KRgzNWt","vrAjuu6V","fA72myNS","RLXEmLF9","geaZKRmc","HyPBt1Fe","dqzzU5Hg","p5Xw2LiZ","hZs482mC","6g4qy5hA","L2ERNR7d","11foeqox","Njd7x8bl","5Ci8FUbU","W6ptfTp3","YlLOkKf9","gDMj0yIi","SHsaZzMU","abEltCPM","14Cmm7Ff","C1VysDYt","A0tzMwVS","DBDZAhwS","JdB9dfE9","ZpFQOEiP","2n9CpLEp","qkfpsoTv","LjUuZyjm","yrru4Bk4","4zvus7f3","AFfAEsKN","YGIJtdMB","P9nARxar","K4DsUBPC","bsaAduNH","931QH0rO","iCN5sXDw","9mloKCRh","8kMVRIPW","aphVtzmS","gzcXPgrI","Ktw36uDC","UXVsHEi6","DWPOKGOj","9kcwkEpR","iz25dG62","nCrLqsV1","QUR4n7cH","EIHSHWKH","1InsTZ7x"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/c5a85914f01be35575abe61c2d19d48e08581034_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"Ktw36uDC","project_id":"n6PXGAoM","author_id":"j0Ha6a2h","featured":false,"name":"BSS (fabric-1.20.1) - v3.12.6","version_number":"3.12.6+fabric-1.20.1","changelog":"## v3.12.5 changelogs:\n- Fixed a consistency bug when it comes to closing the BSS screen. Prior to `1.20.5`, pressing the `Escape` keyboard key on the Statistics screen would unpause the game instead of going back to the game menu screen, so BSS should do the same.\n- You can now `Shift+LMB` (aka shift-click) on the `Statistics` button to quickly open the vanilla statistics screen. This now serves as a shortcut that allows you to access the vanilla stats screen in less clicks.\n- The quick-share feature now logs its related events to `latest.log`, so its easier to debug any errors taking place. When submitting bug reports regarding quick-share errors, please include the logs from now on, so I can actually see what's going on.\n- To reduce network bandwidth usage, the quick-share feature will now compress the statistics using GZip prior to uploading them. I will likely be looking into finding ways to apply compression to downloads as well, so people viewing quick-shared stats can also benefit. For now, the compression only applies to uploads.\n\n## v3.12.6 changelogs\n- The \"Stat announcement system\" feature is now disabled by default, rather than being enabled by default. You can always enable or disable it at any time.\n    - This was done because people download this mod primarily for the BSS itself, whereas SAS is an optional server-sided feature that is not what everyone is here for.\n- The \"Quick-share\" feature has been tweaked a bit, so as to improve its server-sided security and reliability. The tweaks generally boil down to further helping the server combat people looking to exploit the system in a malicious way.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-08-08T09:56:42.864187Z","downloads":145084,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"bda0ac4e8937cfbe38f9a4a8aadb77f6a882407e","sha512":"412824d45c63dec7a629b9efc16ed9fe08c256a8754b54f8052b2a346c7f0febe359757077d5683321b8fffb059707b29a385ae171d6dfaf6e3fb2db26c9a0de"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/versions/Ktw36uDC/betterstats-3.12.6%2Bfabric-1.20.1.jar","filename":"betterstats-3.12.6+fabric-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":385358,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Eldc1g37","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"nfn13YXA","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"6Y0z3ceK","user":{"id":"j0Ha6a2h","username":"TheCSDev","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/66475965?v=4","bio":"Hello there random person.

And that's no coincidence! You can give the statue a name to make look like any Minecraft player. Then there are plenty of options, for equipping the statue with gear, making a custom pose, configuring a few options, and generally for just posing the statue as you wish. Time to breath some more life into your builds!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QrJ2aSu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Placing a straw statue will immediately open the confugration menu. When shift + placing or using dispenser the menu will not open, and the statue will autmatically have a random pose applied. Switch to different screens using the tabs to the left. Quickly switch between those tabs by pressing the <code>Tab</code> key.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/43/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Rotations Screen</strong> allows you to freely move around head, cape, both arms and both legs. Rotation values are restricted to a certain range to prevent weird rotations. To unlock this restriction, simply click the lock icon to move sliders on the full range of 360 degrees. When moving the sliders with your cursor isn't precise enough, try clicking a slider first, then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it around with greater accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The screen also offers buttons for reseting the current pose, for creating a random pose, and also two buttons for copying the current pose and pasting it elsewhere. You can only copy one pose at a time.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/46/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The next screen is the <strong>Poses Screen</strong>. Here you are offered a selection of bult-in poses to choose from. After selecting a pose you can also go back to the rotations screen to customize that pose. Built-in poses are the same as armor stand poses found on Bedrock Edition, so you might already be familir with them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/50/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Style Screen</strong> gives access to some basic options, such as turning the statue into a child. You can also set a name, which will define the skin used by a straw statue. The <i>Sealed</i> option is only available to creative mode players.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/51/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Model Parts Screen</strong> allows control over the different model layers of the current player skin. The options will only have an effect when the skin contains such elements. This screen is pretty much the same as the <i>Skin Customization</i> screen in Minecraft.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/52/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Position Screen</strong> allows you to place the straw statue with great precision, you can also change the rotation. To be able to better see how you're rotating/moving the statue around, click the magnifying glass button to hide most screen elements and give you a clear view. When moving the statue around a lot it probably is a good idea to disable its gravity on the style screen.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/54/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Finally the <strong>Equipment Screen</strong> gives you access to the armor stands equipment slots via a menu. This screen only shows up when Armor Statues is installed both client- and server-side.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/QrJ2aSu.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/31/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/34/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>A simple straw statue, time to dress up!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Put some equipment on your statue</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/37/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/41/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>And set a player skin!

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

Model Features (EMF) is a Fabric, Quilt & Forge mod that adds support for OptiFine's Custom Entity Models (CEM).<br />It's designed for anyone who wants to use the CEM resource pack features but to use mods such as Sodium, Continuity or ETF.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/49f5b98dfef5b073a3971750673d343e1f92efe5.png\" alt=\"EMF in use\" width=550>\n\n</div>\n\n## Required Mods\nPlease also install the below mods if you can, the obvious ones such as Sodium are not mentioned.\n\nIt should also go without saying EMF is NOT compatible with dorianpb's CEM and OptiFabric.\n#### Required\n- [Entity Texture Features (ETF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures): \n  EMF uses several features from my other mod ETF, so it is required. (primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n##

zoom mod with infinite customizability.*\n\nZoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.\n\n![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - Developer\n- [MoonTidez](https://github.com/MoonTidez) - Logo designer\n\n#### Translators\nLanguages in alphabetical order\n\n- [神枪968](https://github.com/GodGun968) - 简体中文 / Chinese (Simplified)\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) - English (United Kingdom)\n- [Madis0](https://github.com/Madis0) - eesti keel / Estonian\n- [co-91](https://github.com/co-91) - 日本語 / Japanese\n- [Rodrigo Appelt](https://github.com/Agentew04) - Português / Portuguese\n- [SyberiaK](https://github.com/SyberiaK) - Русский / Russian\n- [Felix14-v2](https://github.com/Felix14-v2) - Русский / Russian\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (mexicano) / Spanish (Mexico)\n- [Zetsphiron](https://github.com/Zetsphiron) - Español (españa) / Spanish (Spain)\n- [localfossa](https://github.com/localfossa) - Türkçe / Turkish\n- [Im Vietnam](https://github.com/ImVietnam) - Tiếng Việt / Vietnamese\n","published":"2022-01-29T20:52:18.744493Z","updated":"2024-10-23T17:25:46.111444Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":7161476,"followers":3813,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1","1.21.2","1.21.3"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["iVw60IvO","cgp0M9ZD","gUBtDUBp","4Kmn0eeU","p4qDdICN","87tTbECt","Z7VJkXXa","2ZC7Fxc8","jfoKe5Fr","HDVevQGA","Dqby42rh","ywAz0NBY","LropUbSI","yRrEHsQ0","qJLT1UZa","t2MUOMy5","IjbCI21q","ClfJLhWu","ssxmDm4w","3bwXGtwH","vdNR7RSe","VqJlUKUp","BrGdvUUq","zS4oS6ht","sC6H3PnU","TQKBOZaT","nls01OIv","f017okM4","YHh8fxDi","p5RjeOJL","mIiMyney","1mKrqlvv","tv8GIQDa","1AYfSJ9O","gZr7EykF","QRQLkNPJ","JiEpJuon","8cY8HQIg","BalILUb7","LIBdkZvZ","FiLFLGIB","VfWNmPC4","eLEIUtBo","8BIz17tA","OggLUOr6","66iHgfN8","vg7GaKbh","twJQAslW","hzEfkIGF","8VBKUY5S","mGFci27z","RKRjd2h1","R3KFePo9","oK8ySMgf","RW06GEHk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/w7ThoJFB/e2de67a0bfb9e8aa2347982ab3ec5463f26cca31_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"RW06GEHk","project_id":"w7ThoJFB","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"Zoomify 2.14.2 for MC 1.20.1","version_number":"2.14.2+1.20.1","changelog":"No changelog provided.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-10-23T17:25:46.795836Z","downloads":19308,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"7e1b7b1fcf2e0e7dd55f4131b2d49b8df1fc0a2f","sha512":"5ab72d28f2fd3da28818256b849c38d3a0da7d8b38222785dc34ab99e301141e95e904984fb7ec693f699e71d955f7ddcf0e437d02eee1ddb058e6f2ea485afa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/w7ThoJFB/versions/RW06GEHk/Zoomify-2.14.2%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"Zoomify-2.14.2+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":807877,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"1eAoo2KR","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"VAryyl46","user":{"id":"nyx2i4fB","username":"isxander","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/43245524?v=4","bio":"Kotlin & Java Developer\n\nhttps://www.isxander.dev/","created":"2021-07-23T18:53:58.220173Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"Zoomify-2.14.2+1.20.1.jar"},"mods/EndRespawnAnchorMod.jar":{"sha512":"b3f7d13790131f811e567367437a505254f23abed842e815c2693b931bd6c13c34e421bbcb25a0bfb9b1ca1ef1ee22a9f08f0816053f016262fd9481e1267131","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"xmdHQIdW","slug":"end-respawn-anchor","project_type":"mod","team":"UVWB3K8Y","title":"End Respawn Anchor","description":"End Respawn Anchor is a Respawn Anchor's counterpart in the End!","body":"### End Respawn Anchor\nAvailable for Forge 1.18.x ~ 1.20.2 NeoForge 1.20.2~ Fabric 1.20.x~    \nIf you should have any questions or find bugs, feel free to cantact me.  \n\n### Description\nThis mod adds End Respawn Anchor.  \nEnd Respawn Anchor makes you possible respawn in the End just like Respawn Anchor does in the Nether.  \nEnder perls or Ender eyes can be used as fuels. \n**Note that you will always respawn in the End wherever you die.**\n\n<details><summary> For further information </summary>\nMinecraft lets you spawn where respawn position has been set. Therefore, you'll spawn in the End when using exit portal in attempting to teleport to the Overworld. This is quite contrary to our expectatoins where exit portal moves you out of the End. In order to avoid this problem, this mod remembers where your respawn position had been before using End Respawn Anchor and lets you spawn there after entering through exit portal.

With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing a Recipe Viewer mod. Create has full support for <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>, <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/rei\">REI</a>, and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\">EMI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a

Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fyxvi8i.png\" width=\"854\"

**Description**\n\nHarvesting crops is such a pain, breaking them all to get the drops and then having to replant each one.  \nWith this mod you can just right-click on your crops to harvest and replant them in one go!  \nIt's also compatible with **almost any** modded crops, to ease your mind of one more thing!\n\n*Although it's stated that the mod is required server-side only, when a client that does not have the mod connects to a server that does and tries to harvest a crop while holding a block, it causes block flashing.*  \n*The only way to prevent this glitch is to set `require hoe` to `true`.*\n\n## **Features**\n\n- Right-click to harvest any crop, works with both Vanilla and modded out of the box!  \n  ![Harvesting wheat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/harvest-with-ease/wheat.gif)\n- Works on nether warts and cocoa beans too!  \n  ![Harvesting cocoa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/harvest-with-ease/cocoa.gif) ![Harvesting nether wart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/harvest-with-ease/wart.gif)\n- Correctly consumes 1 crop seed to simulate replanting!\n- Right-click while holding an item with fortune to increase drops!\n- **Highly configurable!** See next section for more details.\n\n## **Configuration**\n\n- `require hoe`: whether holding a hoe (either hands) is required to right-click harvest, defaults to `false`.\n- `damage on harvest`: how much damage the hoe should receive upon use, effective only if `> 0` and **`require hoe`** is enabled.\n- `exp on harvest`: how many experience points should be granted when right-click harvesting or break-harvesting, effective only if `> 0` (note it's exp _points_ and not exp _levels_).\n- `multi-harvest starting tier`:  \n  Tool tier starting from which it is possible to harvest multiple crops at once.  \n  All tiers that cannot multi-harvest will have a 1x1 square area of effect (a single crop).  \n  If **`starting harvest area size`** is set to `single` and **`area increment step`** to `none` multi-harvest will be effectively disabled, regardless of this config option value.  \n  When set to `none` multi-harvest will be enabled without a tool too. Note that **`require hoe`** takes precedence.\n- `starting harvest area size`:  \n  Starting multi-harvest area size (square side length).  \n  The area is always a square centered on the right-clicked crop.  \n  Setting this to `single` and **`area increment step`** to `none` will effectively disable multi-harvest.\n- `area increment step`:  \n  Increment step for the harvest area size with higher tool tiers.  \n  Setting this to `none` and **`starting harvest area size`** to `single` will effectively disable multi-harvest.\n- `use seeds from inventory`: whether to use seeds from the player's inventory to replant crops if seeds are not dropped, for example with the pitcher crop.\n- `crops`: list of additional in-game IDs for crops that are not supported out of the box, defaults to an empty list.  \n  This last config option is just a safety measure, so far no crop needs it.\n- `blacklist`: list in-game IDs for crops that under no condition can be right-click harvested.\n- `tiers`: since 1.21, Minecraft removed the concept of tier levels, so you need to specify yourself the tier order. A default one is provided.\n\n## **Dependencies**\n\n| Mod                                                                     |         Loader         | Requirement |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------:|:-----------:|\n| [Cobweb](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobweb)                |          All           |  Required   |\n| [Forge Config API Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port) | Fabric; Forge ≥ 1.20.2 |  Required   |\n\n## **License and right of use**\n\nFeel free to use this mod for any modpack or video, just be sure to give credit and possibly link [here](https://github.com/crystal-nest/harvest-with-ease#readme).  \nThis project is published under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/crystal-nest/harvest-with-ease/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## **For developers**\n\nYour modded crops will work with this mod out of the box only if they extend the CropBlock class, which is how it should be.  \nIf you can't extend that class, the **`crops`** config option is there for you. Just add the in-game ID of your crop(s) to make it work, however note that this will work only if your crops have an Integer Property whose name\nis set to be `\"age\"` and represents the age values your crops can have, from `0` to a `max` value.\n\nSince v6.0.0.0, an API is available to better integrate your mod with this one, if needed.  \nSince v9.0.0, it's possible to blacklist crops via datapack.  \nTo learn how to use the provided API and the datapack feature, follow the [Wiki](https://github.com/crystal-nest/harvest-with-ease/wiki).\n\n## **Support us**\n\n<a

with exceptional attention to detail, high standards of quality, and top tier optimisation. It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Choose Your Style\nComplementary Shaders comes with two distinct visual style options. The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.dev/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:\n* **Backup your saves often**;\n* Make sure everything is working before adding it to a modpack;\n* Report any issues you find to our **[issue tracker](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)**! It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q. Do you have a Patreon, or similar means of supporting your work?***\n> Not currently, but thanks for your consideration! I'm currently well-sustaned by a stable job, and my personal projects are hobbies I work on my free time. My suggestion is to donate your money to more worthy causes, or just treat yourself to a nice lunch. ;)\n\n\n## Links:\n\n* [Discord for Help and Feedbacks (Fabric version)](https://discord.gg/MskvEhPDQz)\n* [Report Issues](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)\n* [Discord of main mod/author (Forge version)](https://discord.gg/eFsz5SK)\n* [Twitter vectorwing (original forge mod author)](https://twitter.com/vectorwing)","published":"2022-06-18T17:51:27.070187Z","updated":"2023-12-08T13:30:25.991858Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1641610,"followers":1242,"categories":["decoration","food","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["FG4vSwZt","EpdWyovh","cRnlUfGm","yx8C6sef","BYSArmvd","vHfAq5KW","RSpZmgnD","GJJkeGOX","j28o9UzD","buJjlyP3","JMZ3SwVr","4POXSYDm","G8lpe9fB","baQ9tohQ","Zlgy4hSU","TSMy7brE","DzmY31OQ","cyNt2Gp3","lpeIiuMj","YFvijG6F","rlm3hWGx","vzoppMtR","QXYNitXw"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4EakbH8e/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"QXYNitXw","project_id":"4EakbH8e","author_id":"8ylDo0gI","featured":true,"name":"1.4.3 - 1.20-1.20.1","version_number":"1.4.3","changelog":"## 1.4.3 - 1.20-1.20.1 *[FD-1.2.0]*\n#### Required dependencies :\n* Fabric Loader : **0.14.21+1.20**\n* Fabric API : >= **0.83.0+1.20**\n\n#### Changelog :\n* fix crops break on non watered farmland **[#206](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/206)** (thanks to _[BarchamMal](https://github.com/BarchamMal)_)\n* add cutting recipes for cherry wood and log **[#219](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/219)** (thanks to _[BarchamMal](https://github.com/BarchamMal)_)\n* add possibility to plant pitcher pods on rich soil **[#189](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/189)** (thanks to _[BarchamMal](https://github.com/BarchamMal)_)\n* fix crash when using the bogey selection menu from create: steam n rails **[#205](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues/205)** (thanks to _[AwesomeDude091](https://github.com/AwesomeDude091)_)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-08T13:30:28.735014Z","downloads":668093,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0645dd6af99cee2e00d766a0a221dce93ce8be72f5a968639e29681800972c9cdb7e2aebab0000e9909a7398173497e43ce9ac22eaa7b51ad9e6d411bf81b493","sha1":"758d7931e769dc4a78ff6642976cffbe75a522cb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4EakbH8e/versions/QXYNitXw/farmers-delight-fabric-1.4.3.jar","filename":"farmers-delight-fabric-1.4.3.jar","primary":true,"size":2718948,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"hFdJG9fY","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"S5wyPP3c","user":{"id":"8ylDo0gI","username":"Zifiv","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/833854?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-18T17:41:39.413791Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"farmers-delight-fabric-1.4.3.jar"},"mods/molten_metals-1.20.1-0.1.4-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"3c6df2db5939a1d64710d972b9abaed68a1af8cb1eaefe9167e4eedc4a28580c69eb439f2bad99e056eaee04225b1f20e07f5c0d97184df5397df6772850fc84","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5ZuwMbpk","slug":"create-molten-metals","project_type":"mod","team":"UhfCRaPj","title":"Create: Molten Metals","description":"Melt down metals, cast ingots and engage in metallurgy with Create: Molten Metals","body":"# MELT DOWN YOUR ORES\nDo you have a Tinkers' Construct shaped hole in your heart?

|\n\n---\n\n### Modpack Configuration\n\nRecipes are driven by defining **Tool Materials**, **Armor Materials**, **Equipment Types**, and **Unit Cost Overrides**.\n\n- **Materials** inherit from vanilla tool/armor materials. They define upgrade paths like Iron->Diamond.\n    - By default, all vanilla materials are defined.\n- **Types** define \"alike\" items. Items with matching types can upgrade .\n    - By default, the 5 tools (e.g. `c:swords`) and 4 armor slots are defined.\n- **Unit Cost** is what an item costs to upgrade to or repair. It's usually guessed from the material and a recipe.\n    - By default, vanilla non-tool/armor items are made repairable by overriding this.\n    - Netherite is also overridden to have appropriate diamond unit costs.\n\nFor data structure examples, check out the [built-in datapack](https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-smithing/tree/1.19/src/main/resources/data/minecraft) or the mod compatibility packs in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-quilt/tree/1.19_modded/resources/datapacks).\n\n---\n\n### Older Versions\n\nFor minecraft 1.15-1.17, 1.0 is available as a [datapack](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-smithing/tree/nbtc2/src/main/resources) for [NBT Crafting](https://modrinth.com/mod/nbt-crafting) - see the [old readme](https://github.com/sisby-folk/tinkerers-smithing/blob/nbtc2-experiments/README.md) for features.\n\n---\n\n### Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.\n\n---\n\n<center>\n<b>Tinkerer's:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt\">Quilt</a> - <i>Smithing</i> - <a

We want to introduce new players to atlas, and make it easier to maintain and improve.<br/>\n`0.x` uses arch, keeps the old `antiqueatlas` ID, and is API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas).<br/>\n`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.<br/>\n`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save/API/network/respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>\n\nOnce stable and feature-complete, we intend to maintain atlas on most modpack versions >=1.18.2 ([more info](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues/81))\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThe art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>\n[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/CREDITS) for detailed art credit.\n\nThis mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>\nWe can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to better ways to implement our mods.

Adventure Begin?\n\nCreate: Let The Adventure Begin is an add-on for Create that implements naturally generating structures with create mod features. The focus of this add-on is to make the world more fun to explore and worthwhile on a Create mod aspect. It also offers a new way to kickstart your Create mod adventure by showcasing some of the uses of the Create mod. This could include something like the rare windmill, which demonstrates the power of sails and windmill bearings (check out the gallery for a preview of some of the structures).\n\nWatch the trailer on Youtube here:\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7DPhYA4PdCM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n### Updates status:\n\nSince I am the only developer of this mod, development is a bit slow, so don’t expect too many updates. If I ever stop development, I will make sure to announce it here.\n\n### Bugs and glitches:\n\nThe Create mod wasn’t designed for generating structures, so sometimes there are some bugs. These bugs could be waterwheels missing or mechanical belts that won't spin. I have done my best to fix as many of these as I can, but there are still a few issues. If you find any gamebreaking please report it on the issues page on Create: Let The Adventure Begins github.\n\n\n\n\n\n","published":"2024-04-23T10:09:49.671536Z","updated":"2024-10-18T21:47:30.561199Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":27742,"followers":41,"categories":["adventure","decoration","worldgen"],"additional_categories":["game-mechanics"],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["28yCN99b","4xFm8PmE","t6dKdbhL","7eQiSuJh","CPUr32xq","sudwpFD8","foASRpBN","d9Ovwgb9","Zvl1Yj7y","DD1JmMH5","BBgrEpqv","F3JTxdw9","tD7BIOT7","HLGCDWx0","vdGzng7i","YSG8mxYD","v7tOoanV","qIW9lF8C","ew3LwO5v","P3jD6lZz"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/fUa6OtBG/13abb03de2fbba9cbcbeb56d97475e7cc147b18b_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"P3jD6lZz","project_id":"fUa6OtBG","author_id":"SuHe2LBj","featured":false,"name":"Create:

width=25> Keep Some Inventory\n\n<font color=\"#14CC14\">**Isn't it annoying when you die and your items are far away and surrounded by danger?**</font>\n\nWith this data pack no longer, since you <font color=\"#14CC14\">**keep your fighting equipment**</font> like weapons, tools and armor <font color=\"#14CC14\">**on you when dying**</font>!\n\n## Overview\n**Personally I don't like** playing with the `keepInventory` gamerule set to `true` because it feels cheap to go somewhere dangerous **without the risk** of losing anything.\nThis data pack aims to give dangerous areas their **risk back** while still allowing you to **use your best equipment** that you spent hours on farming, crafting and enchanting.\n\n## Features\n- When dying, you **keep all your equipment** on you while still **dropping your resources**.\n- Your items **will not splatter**, they all stay at the exact location you died at, **no items flying into lava or off of cliffs**.\n- At the location of your death you can collect **all your experience** and it is **not limited** to about 7 levels, like in vanilla minecraft.\n- After dying, your **items and experience will despawn after 10 minutes** instead of despawning after the normal 5 minutes.\n\n## Compatability\n- This pack will most likely **not work** together with grave packs or packs doing anything to items on death.\n- This pack makes use of **vanilla item tags** and the **convention of common `c` tags** used by mod loaders, and may therefore be compatible with mods - no guarantee.\n- You can **modify the items that should be dropped** on death by opening the zip/jar and modifying the tag located at `data/pskeep2/tags/item/drop.json`.\n\n---\n[![PuckiSilver on

On the right side of the screen, it shows more details about the mod, such as authors, a description, links, credits, and a button to configure the mod.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/images/155dd2b006883b168b1279ec0ff21e753946518b.png)\n\nMod Menu lets you view the mods you have installed and, if supported by the mod, enables quick and easy access to the mod's config screens.\n\nMod Menu also supports some more advanced features, such as translatable mod names and descriptions, support for [QuickText formatting](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext/) in mod descriptions thanks to [Patbox](https://ko-fi.com/patbox)'s [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api), filters library mods out from regular mods, a mod update checker for mods hosted on Modrinth or that provide their own update sources, and deep configuration for all the features we provide.\n\n### Supported Platforms\nMod Menu is currently available for Fabric or Quilt on Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14 or newer.\n\n## Developers\nMod Menu includes a number of APIs for developers to improve how their mod appears in Mod Menu. These come in the form of language keys, JSON metadata, and even a Java API.\n\n### Translation API\nYou can translate your mod's name, summary, and description all without touching any Java code. Simply add translation keys in the supported format to any language you'd like.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Translation API Documentation</summary>\n\nHere's an example of Mod Menu's translations into Pirate Speak. To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

new workbench, through which players will have the possibility of recovering enchantments from enchanted objects or books. \n\nFor example, if you have an enchanted sword that is about to break and you want to recover the enchantments, it will be as easy as using this fantastic crafting table to separate them from the sword and incorporate them into a book.\n\n### Do you need a server to play

For example, if you have a pickaxe with efficiency and unbreakability, you will be able to place it on the disenchantment table, to pass the enchantments to a book and keep the pickaxe without enchantment.\n\nIt will always have the same cost, five levels of experience. In addition, you will have the possibility of removing the enchantments individually or all at once. Undoubtedly, it will be very useful to recover valuable enchantments from armor or tools that we no longer want to use.\n\n![FAQ](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/DisEnchanting_Table/BH_DT_faq.webp)\n\n### Does it work on servers?\n### \nSure!

The final goal is to add more structures that perfectly fit Minecraft worlds. This mod adds multiple buildings that suit the ambience and aesthetics of that biome. This pack will add around 30 unique structures to the game by completion.\nThere will be no backporting beyond 1.19 for the mod version and 1.18.2 for the datapack version.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\nThese are just some of the most asked questions I've had from people, but if you have any more, please leave a comment below and I'll try to help you as best I can.\n\n**1. Is it safe to update Immersive structures to a newer version?**\nYes. If any serious problems arise because of that, let me know.\n\n**2. Is it safe to add Immersive structures to an already existing world?**\nYep. Just note that the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n**3. Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nAll of them. I have a universal version for three mod loaders.\n\n**4. How can I locate the new structures?**\nFor 1.18.2: /locate imst:[structure_from_list]<br />For 1.19+: /locate structure imst:[structure_from_list]\n\n**5. Does Immersive structures modify existing vanilla structures?**\nNo\n\n**6. How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nPlease go to my GitHub repo and make an issue there. A discord message will do.\n\n**7. Can I include Immersive structures in my modpack?**\nSure, but make sure to give credit and a link to our page.\n\n**8. Can I have Immersive structures for 1.x.x, please?**\nSuppose it's lower than 1.19, no. Don't ask this question ever again. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n**10. Can I give Choicetheorem any kind of commission or support?**\nI can't take any commissions or monetary support due to a lack of time and mean to receive payments.\n\n**11. Can I use it on Aternos or any 3rd party downloads?**\nYes, but you can download it via Modrinth, not Curseforge.\n\n**12. Is this server-side or client-side mod?**\nImmersive Structures is a server-side mod.\n</details>\n\n<details><summary>Images</summary>\nSome fantastic footage from the mod.\nAll pictures are taken with complementary shaders or complementary reimagined shaders.\n\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/473/586/2022-06-26_21.png)\n![](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/473/584/2022-06-21_12.png)\n</details>\n\n## **Credits**\n+ Vichy0623 for codesigning the builds</span></p>\n\n<details><summary>Compatible mods</summary>\n\n+ Most world generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome you'll go, Biomes O plenty.\n+ Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures.\n+ Any other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem like ChoiceTheorem's overhauled village.\n</details>","published":"2022-07-09T15:48:22.443878Z","updated":"2024-07-28T08:50:19.206697Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":248241,"followers":430,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["s8BGCLGu","7SDA6FyX","avSpKzc6","QhF6sVFu","NKTqQ0bO","e7rJNBPs","danTqbxA","C1fCIQSh","f8kEK0IG","sBY4jR5x"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/CVBAErky/icon.jpeg"},"version":{"id":"C1fCIQSh","project_id":"CVBAErky","author_id":"srhKvhLi","featured":true,"name":"[Universal]IMST-v2.1.0","version_number":"2.1.0","changelog":"- Ported to 1.20","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-11T09:16:15.936200Z","downloads":160120,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c5dc394d4bce5561490826c849735a1f685ebd810f2483e97f0d2dc0941b01da62e0d0644a87abda6fa425a318d184fdb4ce8c700bfc982323177f8f59757ae2","sha1":"1a239310e4020679338322ba9c7108305aa2a684"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/CVBAErky/versions/C1fCIQSh/imst-2.1.0.jar","filename":"imst-2.1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":463596,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hJrwdhvG","user":{"id":"srhKvhLi","username":"ChoiceTheorem","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/srhKvhLi/04e301eff4942eeaa7c4540eb9d299021e049b58.png","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-29T10:01:27.627748Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"imst-2.1.0.jar"},"mods/CreateTweaker-fabric-1.20.1-4.0.13.jar":{"sha512":"61a93db730ba9499e930f3465f5ed00f57cd677930e66385e7dbbcde9eb51402141ed265dc721532ec87cf92e04392787c1a026c9ab4b15da5e817a2bb1babef","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"vEila6nl","slug":"createtweaker","project_type":"mod","team":"afi77MkH","title":"CreateTweaker","description":"Adds CraftTweaker support for Create","body":"<div>\n<p>CreateTweaker is an Addon for CraftTweaker and Create adding CraftTweaker support for Create Machines.</p>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<p>The documentation can be found <a href=\"https://docs.blamejared.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n</div>\n\nIf you would like to support me in my modding endeavors, you can become a patron via **[![Patreon logo](https://i.imgur.com/CAJuExT.png) Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jaredlll08)**.\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/jared.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/jared)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

I went from changing shader settings to adding shader settings. Eventually i decided i wanted to try and bring out my own visual taste in the shader. So here i am, with a pretty sizeable edit of chocapic13's shaders.\n\n# Requirements\n- AMD graphics card\n- Nvidia graphics card\n- Apple Devices or Intel Integrated Graphics are low priority. USE IRIS FOR BEST RESULTS\n- Optifine or Iris. Oculus might work but i will not give it attention. \n- Designed for Minecraft versions 1.17 +\n- Mod support is not going to happen unless i need to make minimal changes for it to work.\n\n# Questions? Bugs?

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI.

you return to the Title Screen early while your world is still saving in the background!","body":"## FastQuit\n\n### About this mod\n\nThis mod lets you return to the title screen early while your world is still saving in the background.\n\nDon't worry, the mod will wait for the world to finish saving when necessary, no data will be lost!\n\nThe world will show up on the world list, and you can even edit, delete or recreate it while it is still saving.\nThis is done by reusing the info from the still saving world.\n\nIn its current state this should be safe to do as measures for thread safety have been taken.\nIf you do somehow still encounter an issue, the worst thing to happen will be the action failing and Minecraft showing you a toast informing you of it.\n\n**If that happens, please [open an issue](#problems) with your .minecraft/logs/latest.log file attached!**\n\n### Join the Discord!\n\nIf you are interested in my mods or have any questions, you can join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6ZV8SF672)!\n\n### Configure\n\nTo configure the mod, open the config screen from [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or go to .minecraft/config/fastquit-config.txt.\n\nThere is currently three options to configure:\n\n**Show Toasts**:\n\nDetermines whether a toast gets shown when a world finishes saving.\n\n**Background Thread Priority**:\n\nSets the thread priority of the server when saving worlds in the background.\nThis is done to improve client performance while saving, but will make the saving take longer over all.\nValue has to be between 0 and 10, setting it to 0 will disable changing thread priority.\n\n**Render \"Saving world\" Screen**:\n\nWhen playing on high render distance, quitting the world can still take a bit because the client-side chunk storage has to be cleared.\nBy enabling this setting the \"Saving world\" screen will be rendered.\n\n**Show Saving Time**\n\nDetermines whether the time it took to save the world gets displayed on toasts and the world list.\nValue has to be between 0 and 2, with 0 never showing the time, 1 only on the toast and 2 also on the world list. In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nFast Backups:\n- crash on world exit when \"Allow multiple running Worlds\" is ON\n- (FIXED in Fast Backups v0.17+) crash when quitting Minecraft immediately after world exit, fixed in newer versions of Fast Backup\n\nWakes:\n- crash on world exit with Wakes 0.3.0\n\nIf you suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

It does require OptiFine to work, though.\n\n> **Q: Can you make a Bedrock port?**  \n> **A:**  It's not as simple as porting it. To make a version that would work on Bedrock, I would have to start from scratch. So that's not something I plan to do any time soon if ever.\n\n> **Q: Can you add player animations?**  \n> **A:**  Sadly no. Optifine currently doesn't support player animations. It may be possible with other mods, but I haven't looked into it yet.\n\n> **Q: Why isn't the ___ animated? Can you add it?**  \n> **A:**  Not all the mobs are animated yet. Fresh Animations is a Beta pack so it is developed over time, so new mobs animations will be added in major updates.  \n> I work and add new animations at my own pace, so please refrain from requesting animations.\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have white eyes and no new animations when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This occurs when you haven't installed the Optifine Mod correctly, OR Custom Entity Models is not enabled in Video Settings. The required settings are as follows:  \n> _Video Settings > Quality > Custom Entity Models: ON_  \n> **A:**  This can also happen with some 3rd party clients.  \n> **A:**  Also make sure you're using the right Optifine version (refer to the next question below).\n\n> **Q: Why are the mobs invisible / have invisible parts?**  \n> **A:**  This happens with some game versions including 1.18.1, 1.18 and 1.17.x. Use Optifine HD U H9 or newer to use the main pack.  \n> For 1.18 and 1.17.x, use the alternative version of the resource pack  [(FreshAnimations_v1.7_Alt.zip)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/fresh-animations/files/3919356).\n\n> **Q: Why do some mobs have big purple/black textures when I load the resource pack?**  \n> **A:**  This often occurs when the pack is loaded in. I think it's caused by an Optifine bug. To solve this, you need to exit the game and re-launch it.\n\n> **Q: Is Fresh Animations compatible with ___ ?**  \n> **A:**  Probably not completely. Textures for some mobs break with other packs as they are resized in FA. Other packs with custom entity models won't work as it would override the models FA.  \n> Otherwise, textures for most mobs should be fine. A solution for some packs is to make an 'addon' version using Optifine CEM Parts.\n\n> **Q: The pack is warning me that it's made for another version of Minecraft. Which version should I get?**  \n> **A:**  Any version of this pack should work as intended in most versions, as long as there's a version of Optifine to run it. I recommend using the latest version for the latest updates and new animations.\n> Don't worry about the version warning!\n\n> **Q: Is there a way to use Fresh Animations without OptiFine?**  \n> **A:**  Fresh Animations requires Optifine features like Custom Entity Models (CEM) to work. Some Optifine CEM alternative mods are being developed. I recommend [Entity Model Features](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features).\n</details>\n\n----------\n\n![ToS](https://imgur.com/zqDp5zR.png)\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Terms of Use:</summary>  \n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n**Fresh Animations: Terms & Conditions**\n\n____________________________________________\n\n- By using this resource pack, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions\n- FreshLX is the creator and copyright owner of this resource pack\n- These terms are subject to change at any time\n- These terms only apply if you intend to use the resource pack in your own content you want to share publicly\n- The terms listed on the official project CurseForge, Modrinth, and Planet Minecraft pages, supersede any license, readme or terms/conditions information provided anywhere else, including in the resource pack files\n- Not all the assets/elements of this resource pack are subject to these terms.

Not only can you finally give them something to hold in survival mode, you can also freely configure all body parts to pose armor stands as you please. And that's not all! There is a set of built-in poses to choose from, a settings panel for various properties of armor stands, and also great tools for positioning the armor stand, even in ways where you can use it to only display items. And best of all: This mod works on servers without it! You'll need operator rights though. And when the mod is installed on both client and server, all players can use it freely without any permission requirement. Also a few additional features will become accessible.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To use the handy new screen added by Armor Statues, you'll have to shift + right-click an armor stand placed in the world. This will open the last screen you were using. Switch to different screens using the tabs to the left. Quickly switch between those tabs by pressing the <code>Tab</code> key.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/55/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Rotations Screen</strong> allows you to freely move around head, body, both arms and both legs. Rotation values are restricted to a certain range to prevent weird rotations. To unlock this restriction, simply click the lock icon to move sliders on the full range of 360 degrees. When moving the sliders with your cursor isn't precise enough, try clicking a slider first, then use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move it around with greater accuracy.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The screen also offers buttons for reseting the current pose, for creating a random pose, and also two buttons for copying the current pose and pasting it elsewhere. You can only copy one pose at a time.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/56/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The next screen is the <strong>Poses Screen</strong>. Here you are offered a selection of bult-in poses to choose from. After selecting a pose you can also go back to the rotations screen to customize that pose. Built-in poses are the same as found on Bedrock Edition, so you might already be familir with them.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/57/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Style Screen</strong> gives access to some of the basic armor stand options. You can also set a name, which will show above the armor stand, directly in the gui, so you don't have to use a name tag. The <i>Sealed</i> option is only available to creative mode players.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/58/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Position Screen</strong> allows you to place the armor stand with great precision, you can also change the rotation. To be able to better see how you're rotating/moving the armor stand around, click the magnifying glass button to hide most screen elements and give you a clear view. When moving the armor stand around a lot it probably is a good idea to disable its gravity on the style screen.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/60/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The <strong>Alignments Screen</strong> is directly taken from the <a href=\"https://vanillatweaks.net/\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>VanillaTweaks</strong></span></a> <i>Armor Statues</i> data pack. Here you can position an item or block held by the armor stand, and also hide the armor stand, so the item/block appears only by itself.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/61/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Finally the <strong>Equipment Screen</strong> gives you access to the armor stands equipment slots via a menu. This screen only shows up when Armor Statues is installed both client- and server-side.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/55/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/56/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Change rotations of every single body part</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Choose a built-in pose, or set it as a base for your own</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/57/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/58/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Set some settings, and select a name</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Move your statue to an ideal spot with great precision</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/59/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/60/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Enter focus mode to better see what you're actually doing</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use armor stands to place items in the world</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/61/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Set new equipment directly in the screen</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I cannot edit armor stands on my vanilla server!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Make sure you have operator right on the server you are trying to edit armor stands on. When not present on the server, Armor Statues sends vanilla commands to the server to change armor stand values.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BDxblqV.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

it.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/9Pk89J3g/images/52d772df289c00b9c73d5ebd5280e2992441a9f9.png)\n\n##### **Integrations**\n\nIf you're interested in integrations to **your** mod or **X** mod,

This reduces the amount of time and effort required to develop certain mods and features. The Library's code base is also tested in a wider range of circumstances and communities which can lead to less bugs and better performance in mods.</p>\n\n<h3>Features for Players</h3>\n<p>While this mod is primarily for mod authors, there are a few useful features for Players.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands</a> like /bookshelf hand to get item IDs.</li>\n<li>Many new <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs\" rel=\"nofollow\">datapack features</a> like crafting recipes that damage items with durability rather than consuming them.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Features for Modders</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/blob/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/serialization/Serializers.java\" rel=\"nofollow\">Serialization for JSON/Network/NBT formats.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/util\" rel=\"nofollow\">Utility Functions.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/tree/1.16.5/src/main/java/net/darkhax/bookshelf/registry\" rel=\"nofollow\">Registry manager, including non-forge registry types, debugging, and statistics.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Commands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Debug commands.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#recipe-types\" rel=\"nofollow\">New recipe types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#ingredients\" rel=\"nofollow\">New ingredient types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#loot-conditions\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot condition types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#global-loot-modifiers\" rel=\"nofollow\">New loot modifier types.</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki/Data-Packs#item-predicates\" rel=\"nofollow\">New item predicates.</a></li>\n<li>Check <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf\" rel=\"nofollow\">GitHub</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/Darkhax-Minecraft/Bookshelf/wiki\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wiki</a> for more!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

client-side mod that adds RPG-like titles when entering biomes or dimensions.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely customizable - change text size, color, location, duration, &amp; more</li>\n<li><b>Includes built-in titles for many modded dimensions</b> - Atum, Twilight Forest, Bumblezone, Lost Cities, &amp; more!</li>\n<li>Supports <b>all modded biomes</b></li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom titles with the Waystones mod!</b> Will display a Waystone's title when you're near it (1.18+ Forge only)</li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom sounds</b> when entering new biomes, dimensions, or Waystone regions</li>\n<li>Dimension &amp; biome blacklisting</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Beautiful Custom Dimension Titles \n\n<p>\nTry out the beautiful <a title=\"Visual Traveler's Titles\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visual-travelers-titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Traveler's Titles</a> resource pack add-on by UnRoman for completely custom dimension titles! It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:26:24.670551Z","updated":"2024-10-14T20:54:58.523710Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1067121,"followers":990,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["nIfqKsvT","yLYslqqw","8j6rQRir","U7s0a0fP","olf32JwT","yOjVCeqk","ZA3ahpCR","xcHI86YI","oUSK4sOQ","MbifZGB0","TTAtymNe","zbwk2CBy","vsCE3dyt","yMVTlUDY","Hyc60sDr","qslgngRE","Lg8WJPHv","1GrJmc2G","t0B1JBpA","29MQbkrU","CyPFY6w5"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/e7743f2d78a52a1af0ebe5aacbfa940094c63dff_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"MbifZGB0","project_id":"JtifUr64","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.2 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.20-Fabric-4.0.2","changelog":"- Added support for the following mods: Mine Cells, Eden Ring, Deeper Darker, Aether, The True Backrooms, VoidZ, Atlantis.  \n- Added partial Chinese and Japanese translations.  \n\nIf you want to get early access to all my mods, [Join the Patreon!](https://www.patreon.com/yungnickyoung)  \n[Join us on Discord!](https://discord.gg/rns3beq)  \n[Follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yungnickyoung) for more mod updates!","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-28T20:30:11.867199Z","downloads":212950,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"a8af88107664482f907e5e797156f677e79f96009b834a77f38c184cc651b88db5adac2f4edd8c6945a199157eedd9a366774f7a52458e8286fdbb492d4d8787","sha1":"9698f7347b3c98276e4d4035e731e34e926e82d0"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/versions/MbifZGB0/TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar","filename":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar","primary":true,"size":345764,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ua7DFN59","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"cn94wA70","user":{"id":"HCGwycZf","username":"YUNGNICKYOUNG","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/HCGwycZf/f4ec4b86f9778f12367fbd3a3e9f9e6af6830bee.png","bio":"Mr. Better Minecraft","created":"2022-11-13T01:46:47.603854Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Developer","ordering":0},{"team_id":"cn94wA70","user":{"id":"f74fCorY","username":"Drullkus","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/5010174?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-12T01:48:09.113754Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"TravelersTitles-1.20-Fabric-4.0.2.jar"},"mods/geckolib-fabric-1.20.1-4.4.9.jar":{"sha512":"9031c075b1935b6235a5184f376463d36c4090ff50c5f1ca4edd1521777a4bb321a379c12dc0033453a60c36bae054d0e07d56f652dff2b8525ee7756979ff11","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8BmcQJ2H","slug":"geckolib","project_type":"mod","team":"XGT1SohE","title":"Geckolib","description":"A 3D animation library for entities, blocks, items, armor, and more!","body":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fjDJ4jM.png\" alt=\"logo\"/> \n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/pPEqBgJtZW\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/730912704776110121?color=green&label=Discord&logo=Discord&logoColor=green&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"discord\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/geckosmods\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=geckosmods&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&color=green&logoColor=green\" alt=\"patreon\"/> </a>\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:10vw\">GeckoLib is an animation and rendering engine for Minecraft Mods, with support for complex 3D keyframe-based animations, 30+ easings, concurrent animation support, sound and particle keyframes, event keyframes, and more.

This special item allows players to keep their inventory items upon death. The ticket is consumed in the process, making it a valuable and strategic resource.\n\n## Locations and Probabilities\nThe \"Ticket of Eternal Keeping\" can be found in various structures within the game, each with different appearance probabilities:\n\n| Structure       | Appearance Probability |\n|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Ancient City    | 10%                    |\n| Mineshaft       | 3%                     |\n| Stronghold      | 5%                     |\n| End Cities      | 5%                     |\n| Bastions        | 15%                    |\n| Villages        | 0.5%                   |\n| Ruined Portals  | 0.5%                   |\n| Shipwrecks      | 0.5%                   |\n| Other           | 0.5%                   |\n## Config\nthe Toek item is configurable, the file is located in the folder .minecraft/config (or server_folder/config for servers) and is named ToEK.json\n\n```json\n{\n  \"item\": \"minecraft:paper\",\n  \"name\": \"&6Ticket of Eternal Keeping\",\n  \"lore\": [\n    \"&bThis ticket allows whoever carries it\",\n    \"&bin the inventory to keep their items when they die.\",\n    \"\",\n    \"&4&lIt is consumed at death\"\n  ],\n  \"CustomModelDataNumber\": 506\n}\n```\n\nIn this file there are some configurable fields, it also accepts '&' for color codes.\n\n`item`: allows you to change the item that the game uses for the ticket; however, doing this removes the textures in the client, it is important to know that the chosen item can still be used for recipes and fulfill its functions, for example, choosing a block and using the right click can cause the object to be lost.\n\n`name`: change the name\n\n`lore`: is the description of the item, it accepts as many lines as you like, just add a new one between the square brackets ('[')\n\n`CustomModeDataNumber`: number used for custom texture pack, with this it is possible to force a texture pack from the server to the players so they can have a desired texture for the item.\n\n\n## Installation\nTo install this mod, simply download the `.jar` file and place it in your Minecraft mods folder.\nThis mod is designed to work on the server side. It provides a convenient solution for server administrators who want to enhance the gameplay experience without requiring players to install additional mods.\n\n\nIn case you want users to have texture you can use the texture pack from the following [release](https://github.com/Gsimken/Ticket-of-Eternal-Keep/releases/tag/V1.1.0) on the server\n \n## Commands\nToek has a command that allows an operator or whoever has the `toek.command.getticket` permission to generate a ticket at will, this ticket can be given to the player who invokes the command using `/getticket` or to another player using `/getticket playerName`.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Future Work\nThe development team of the \"Ticket of Eternal Keeping\" mod is continuously working on improvements and expansions. The roadmap for future updates includes:\n\n-  ~~**Textures for Clients with the Mod Installed**: The team is looking into allowing clients with the mod installed to see a unique texture for the \"Ticket of Eternal Keeping\".~~\n- ~~**Item Configurability**: Plans are in place to make the item used for the \"Ticket of Eternal Keeping\" configurable, allowing server administrators or players to customize the specific item to be used.~~\n- ~~**Customization of Name and Description**: Future versions aim to enable the customization of the item's name and description through configuration files.~~\n- **Configurable Crafting**: An option to enable or disable the crafting of the item within the game is planned.\n- **Adjustable Locations and Probabilities**: Features that allow the adjustment of locations and probabilities for finding the \"Ticket of Eternal Keeping\" in various game structures are intended to be implemented.\n\nContributions are always welcome. If you have ideas or want to contribute to the code, feel free to fork the repository and submit your pull requests.\n\n","published":"2023-12-28T15:47:34.333455Z","updated":"2024-07-08T21:22:34.654839Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":882,"followers":8,"categories":["game-mechanics"],"additional_categories":["equipment","utility"],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.4","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["lfnLE41q","Rj4q6wXD","wGhy4wCl","F9sJEJeG"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rzksOpGQ/109c8a1c3ff2f5a792966144f1bc8599284ec5e1.png"},"version":{"id":"wGhy4wCl","project_id":"rzksOpGQ","author_id":"59HBf7sj","featured":false,"name":"Ticket of Eternal Keep 1.2.1-1.20.1","version_number":"1.2.1-1.20.1","changelog":"Backport to 1.20.1 with some fixes in config","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-21T18:57:55.123685Z","downloads":140,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"cd1cde3a367672448ac0cff9b310c787cb329cd0","sha512":"be61690a0dee7c741649d64f6db275a3e5da4c3bc082a01f67fada78eb51ae168b38cff0b353ee0aadc46dd253aa7346ce52c40ef5f8a8e059c387a1eab77c00"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/rzksOpGQ/versions/wGhy4wCl/ticket-of-eternal-keep-1.2.1-1.20.1.jar","filename":"ticket-of-eternal-keep-1.2.1-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":89662,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"AGyUsZFg","user":{"id":"59HBf7sj","username":"Gsimken","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/54726539?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2023-07-09T21:31:43.891558Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ticket-of-eternal-keep-1.2.1-1.20.1.jar"},"mods/createaddition-fabric+1.20.1-1.2.4.jar":{"sha512":"66bab7b3e0cada74d70cfc921d94f53759dd64189a261bcb7d75c5fd2818bbc375bcaa215d321c1c619092aff34ba56a94ec61e6868788d0e599913e7445341d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kU1G12Nn","slug":"createaddition","project_type":"mod","team":"gi4UGsOA","title":"Create Crafts & Additions","description":"Create Crafts & Additions extends Create and acts as a bridge between electricity and kinetic energy","body":"# Create Crafts & Additions\n### For Minecraft Forge 1.15.2, 1.16.4/5, 1.17.1, 1.18.1/2, 1.19.2, and 1.20.1\nThanks to community contributions, now also for Fabric 1.18.2, and 1.19.2\nWarning!

This can be used by mod packs and servers to define custom recipes and other features for a wide range of mods. It can also be used to change textures, override tooltips, and change other aspects of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Data Packs</h3>\n<p>Data packs are used by Minecraft to load recipes, loot tables, functions, and other game mechanics. Many mods also pull from data packs to handle custom recipe systems and other new mechanics. OpenLoader will load any data packs that are placed in the ~/config/openloader/data folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/data instead. OpenLoader can load zipped and folder packs. You can learn more about data packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Resource Packs</h3>\n<p>Resource packs are used to define textures, translations, sounds, and other client data. You can use them to override existing resources or add completely new ones. These packs are loaded from the ~/config/openloader/resources folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/resources instead. OpenLoader can load zipped or unzipped packs.&nbsp;You can learn more about resource packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>FaQ</h3>\n<p><strong>Does this support mods like Patchouli or BotanyPots?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, packs loaded by this mod will behave exactly like packs loaded through the vanilla systems. So anything that works through the normal resource packs folder or the world datapack folder will work here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My pack is not loading?</strong></p>\n<p>If your pack is not loading it is because you have not followed the instructions properly or have made an invalid pack. Make sure you have the file placed in the right folder and that your pack has a valid pack.mcmeta file. Unfortunately I do not have the time or resources to help you debug your packs, but there are countless resources and communities available to help you make these things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does pack load order work?</strong></p>\n<p>Any resource packs loaded by OpenLoader should be loaded after vanilla and modded resource packs. Data pack load orders are done on a per-world basis instead and can be very annoying. Initially all data packs loaded by this mod will be loaded after vanilla and modded packs. Any mods added to the game after that initial world load will load after all previously loaded packs but only for that world. This can be fixed by using Vanilla's data pack command to correct the world order on a per-world basis. If you need more consistent control over load order I would recommend a scripting tool like <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftTweaker</a> which is more robust and stable than the data pack system.</p>\n\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=forge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=fabric\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabric</a><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-paintings/files/all?filter-status=1&filter-game-version=2020709689:7499\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

This API's main purpose is to help optimize and speed up the development of mods, as well as to avoiding re-writing the same code for every mod that needs to do similar things. Please note that because this mod is a library, it may not offer useful front-end features to the user.\n\n## Dependencies\nNote that \"client\" refers to installing mods to the game launched through a Minecraft launcher, whereas \"server\" refers to installing mods to a server you join through the \"multiplayer\" menu.\n\n| Requirements | Client | Server |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH) | Required as of `1.20.5` | Required as of `1.20.5` |\n\n## Purpose\nAs mentioned earlier, the primary goal of this API is to enhance and accelerate the development of Minecraft mods, while also eliminating the need to rewrite redundant code for each mod that performs similar tasks. In the beginning, the initial purpose of this API mod was to provide a better the GUI system that's easier to work with, but it has since evolved to include various useful events, hooks, and utilities that may be commonly used.\n\n### Mods that use this API\nThis API mod is primarily used by [TheCSDev](https://github.com/TheCSDev) for developing [Better Statistics Screen](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats).\n\n## API features\n### Client-side\n- **GUI System**: A unique, user-friendly UI system that aims to be an improvement from the vanilla GUI system in terms of customization and flexibility.\n- **HUD Screens**: This feature enables the rendering of `Screen`s on the in-game HUD for visual enhancement. Please note, these HUD `Screen`s are for display purposes only and cannot be interacted with via user input.\n\n### Common-side\n- **Auto-config system**: Simplify the creation of JSON configuration files for your mod with this system. It automatically serializes fields of primitive types defined in the config `Class` during the saving and loading of configs.\n- **Event System**: Allows you to listen for various in-game events. It also allows you to define custom events for your mod, which other mods can listen to.\n- **Hooks**: Gain easy access to various game components with the help of these hooks.\n- **Networking**: This API comes with its own custom-payload-network, enabling other mods to communicate in both C2S and S2C directions over the game's network protocol.\n- **Utilities**: Benefit from a range of utilities, including various interfaces, enums, exception types, IO utilities, threading, and more. One such utility is a caching system that allows mods to perform asynchronous operations to fetch/load resources and cache them.\n\n## A simple introduction to the GUI system\nWith the GUI system, you can create your own custom GUI menus, in a simpler way that allows for more customization and flexibility.  \nIn the vanilla GUI system, we use `Screen`s. In this API's GUI system, we use what's called `TScreen`s.\n\nAll GUI components, including `TScreen`, and GUI widgets, can be found in the following package:\n`io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui`.\n\nBelow we will create an example `TScreen` implementation, with a simple button on it that does something when it's clicked:\n```java\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui.screen.TScreen;\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.client.gui.widget.TButtonWidget;\nimport net.minecraft.text.Text;\n\npublic final class ExampleTScreen extends TScreen\n{\n\t/*\n\t * `super` takes a `Text` argument for the screen's title\n\t */\n\tpublic ExampleTScreen() { super(Text.literal(\"Example TScreen\")); }\n\t\n\t/*\n\t * This is where the screen initializes its GUI elements.\n\t * We will add the button widget here.\n\t */\n\tprotected final @Override void init()\n\t{\n\t\t//create the button, and center it on the screen\n\t\tfinal var button = new TButtonWidget(\n\t\t\t(getWidth() / 2) - 50,  //the button's X position. we will center it\n\t\t\t(getHeight() / 2) - 10, //the button's Y position. we will center it\n\t\t\t100, //the button's width\n\t\t\t20   //the button's height\n\t\t);\n\t\t\n\t\t//define a text for the button\n\t\tbutton.setText(Text.literal(\"Click me\"));\n\t\t\n\t\t//now let's do something when the button is clicked\n\t\tbutton.setOnClick(btn ->\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t//print a simple message to the console\n\t\t\t//when the button is clicked\n\t\t\tSystem.out.println(\"Hello World!\");\n\t\t});\n\t\t\n\t\t//and finally, let's add the button to the screen\n\t\taddChild(button);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nNow, we need to open the screen and show it to the user. To do so, we use `MinecraftClient#setScreen(Screen)` (on Fabric), and we use `TScreen#getAsScreen()` to obtain the `Screen` reference. So our final code will look like this:\n```java\nfinal var tscreen = new ExampleTScreen();\nfinal var screen = tscreen.getAsScreen();\nMinecraftClient.getInstance().setScreen(screen);\n```\n\n## A simple introduction to the event system\nThe event system allows you to not only listen for various events already provided by this API, but it also allows you to create and invoke your own custom events.  \nBelow is an example of how you can create your own event, register and unregister listeners, as well as invoke the event:\n```java\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.event.TEvent;\nimport io.github.thecsdev.tcdcommons.api.event.TEventFactory;\n\npublic final class ExampleEvents\n{\n\t/*\n\t * This is how we create a custom event using this API.\n\t * Note that this event system is similar to Architectury API's event system,\n\t * but with some tweaks and additions done to it, for more flexibility.\n\t */\n\tpublic static final TEvent<Runnable> eSomething = TEventFactory.createLoop();\n\t\n\tpublic static final void registerAndUnregisterListener()\n\t{\n\t\t//we first define the listener that will be invoked when the event is invoked\n\t\tfinal Runnable listener = () -> { System.out.println(\"The event was invoked.\"); };\n\t\t\n\t\t//then, this is how we can register it\n\t\teSomething.register(listener);\n\t\t\n\t\t//and then, this is how we can unregister it\n\t\teSomething.unregister(listener);\n\t}\n\t\n\tpublic static final void invokeEvent()\n\t{\n\t\t//we invoke the event by obtaining the \"invoker\",\n\t\t//and calling the functional interface's main function\n\t\t//(in Runnable's case, the main function is `run`)\n\t\teSomething.invoker().run();\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Contributing\nI appreciate and value everyone's contributions to this mod, whether it involves translating the mod, offering feedback, or providing valuable suggestions.

altered world generation with mountain ranges, underground rivers and more!","body":"![Tectonic logo](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/images/3797bb32f05af523d3ec2a76b6c3c4f9187fac50.png)\n\nWelcome to **Tectonic**, a world generation project that aims to transform how terrain is shaped.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nTectonic is available as a datapack and as a Fabric/Neoforge mod. Forge mod versions are discontinued starting with 1.20.5.\n\nIf you are using Terralith with Tectonic **as datapacks**, install [Terratonic](https://modrinth.com/datapack/terratonic) instead of Tectonic. If you are using the two projects **as mods**, you don't need to install anything extra.\n\n## Description\n\nTectonic makes several large, impactful changes to worldgen.\n\nFeatures labeled with 🎚️ can be toggled on and off in the mod version's config file.\n\n### Mountain Ranges\n\nThe way mountains generate has been completely overhauled, with them forming huge mountain ranges that can stretch for thousands of blocks. These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\nThe mod version's config file provides several options for customizing mountain generation:\n- `terrain_scale`: Vertically scales terrain, higher values = more extreme terrain heights\n- `horizontal_mountain_scale`: Horizontally scales mountains, lower values = less steep mountain slopes\n- `increased_height`: Enables a built-in datapack that increases the Overworld build and generation height to 640\n\n### Underground Rivers 🎚️\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn some steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes 🎚️\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans 🎚️\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\nIf the mod version is installed, vanilla Ocean Monuments will generate deeper to compensate for the deeper oceans.\n","published":"2022-10-06T04:20:33.396078Z","updated":"2024-10-22T22:42:05.725689Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":1886455,"followers":3082,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w04a","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1","1.21.2","1.21.3"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["eU3jwc8i","etznjsos","FwjITjTl","hnsJhfYa","5GAlwGt0","VrJPesuB","E5XyYJFU","PXOM0Pjv","WHCoQSwq","tv7QYqaD","YpYTfu5q","b9YiEZG5","hexdXndT","LfqeFzal","Sk2Wj54u","jEweyNSr","8DvETEcQ","kyOyZ959","CrJgVhRz","4FmsVRER","o79iZuLn","nCfuFGUJ","kD3ERzAU","YQW6UEha","iXsm0qYv","Xp7KZG02","31L9TtHa","IKoGJPng","VUDM6p8V","ikU2p37z","E1Z5e43T","T8MN0KIq","kBneO6ki","q8U9JFXx","5xZAjOFp","RffiLNDg","sJqpHn8g","iUOBzhHD","VUseyTDe","TROmHrN8","zTGbIDfc","NqBsgux4","9tb4XPoV","xH89dtCn","tx6rLdUA","xmaHuY49","5TxvYf3R","N2QHzPke","65V8fhDb","mBxJOCQy","yqPldUFz","1yngXVi8","9Vv7T6db","RGkQIH1q","rnuM9oqV","xLL0P4rp","VLm89jvQ","gO9d3ZPd","VpCClpZj","jNMP7968","TO90bMp9","gY8cl3L6","y3NXGAQL","8Efuao80","Ojy7D0Vt","xGrrU4rl","H2lfq68F","aZXeWJ3r","clI4wc2M","ZiVAiJjF","i48vQzPC","DRRt4Y5n","ynecO9fz","IFpAp5hn","jQaYKWuK","LhqG2XwP","KnptosY0","FSoTAxFx","wrLFLHwA","r4G2J8jv","v8KY2Bab","MDe9rNGW","IbkUCeqE","auHmdzit","9mnrN0gn","9d8f6jTA","H8adpDEF","J1stYUhq","uC07kSeb","hxUteWC1","zilH3OEB","nRre3gJp","B8ikTV4r","AMObzXjg","zxad5F1w","JSz09O7J","umXXvt2a","QYMWUmmx","e9CBdRRU","qVtbTiI9","MhcD9zKS","ZuiWuO36","nWsXomh8","8aqi9AIk","OuvLKaSq","QdOMRCHu","cDr6RmdB","DLvzfLkE","LuuhMrWR","U3nLf5FQ","b7XWeQm9","yF5rYeMw","UoMz3Csl","7Eyu3u3m","l84oLPyu","DUO2sSon","8xjEBuem","GDCa6Oor","3Bv8jMdd","7SpXqQOE","lljFYgYz","V5sIuZb1","HDLbGUgm","S1KtHHe1","Vi3BzpLx","9Irq6mv2","3ihp9LVi","E6cjEjyJ","9Av6Hw5P","oL5fugyX","CwFa78DM","yoDucA7W","puGAWnTo","K7yr330z","PFg0zBtc","yyZJI5WW","Yns19ynj","R41DAyGB","iAMHX4A0","224Rz1Y9","kmVnHjCB","b8Bm6rZX","5BXZ6HSM","d6ybgKyA","stwi8gQ3","8WO5E0R9","SbaGFOAG","mM8HgI7J","fGV7xA3X","ILK2Mjvo","WB8iDGI7","eEELb8Hk","V2zn0MVf","2J7Rya3K","WRfNGCWk","XsX5AVbj","9McF70dc","n95EQITE","IzZfgym7","rktqBfn4","XzMtnBsu","FxnYII7v","GxY5oM7Y","WnTtLQwV","J5CxwkWM","2F6VzBcJ","NypAubyx","tCgW744S","YcKxW5iv","VpkImE3i","mSYrCaov","ubqOXeYf","APO6bJT8","8JhzXwo0","hw0WALVM","3puAlKOm"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/c7a4e685e92e64d07860ecee7b8669022fd0985d_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"8JhzXwo0","project_id":"lWDHr9jE","author_id":"MllXIwZc","featured":false,"name":"v2.4.1b ~ Fabric 1.20.1","version_number":"2.4.1b","changelog":"- Fixed `increased_height` *still* not properly working with Terralith on Fabric.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-09-11T01:19:26.565916Z","downloads":62949,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"baa9c26d6af9cb902be8dd2a850f0f4229e2ed44cc3c3be83e4f6d8e977b3b8bdbf341436aa247b57585f1ad43f6ecf42c7268d30c015da12ae6d991f3927227","sha1":"d216978b144dd95b79176d3941ea85bf2bcc0db7"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/versions/8JhzXwo0/tectonic-fabric-1.20.1-2.4.1b.jar","filename":"tectonic-fabric-1.20.1-2.4.1b.jar","primary":true,"size":349635,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"XaDC71GB","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"ka5u9Zv5","user":{"id":"MllXIwZc","username":"Apollo","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/102649729?v=4","bio":"I'm a solo datapack and mod developer, with a focus on world generation.

Once you clear the temple (i.e. kill the pharaoh at the end of the temple), the mining fatigue effect for that temple will be permanently lifted! You can disable this feature in the config.

In that sense, it is an automatic _Cutting Board_.  \nIn order to use it, the correct tool has to be placed into the machine, using `Right-Click`.\nBy default, only knives and axes are allowed, but this behaviour can be overwritten by modifying the `sliceanddice:allowed_tools` item tag.\nAn example datapack which adds shears to this tag can be found [here](https://github.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/raw/1.20.x/example_datapack.zip)\n\n### Automatic Cooking\n\nAll recipes from Farmer's delight requiring the Cooking Pot are added as heated mixing recipes.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/cooking.png)\n\n### Sprinkler\n\nThe Sprinkler is a block which, when provided with a fluid using a pipe, will distribute it in a small area below.  \nDifferent fluids can have different effects.\n\n- Lava applies a small amount of fire damage to entities below\n- Water makes the area below wet, making the world think it's raining there.\n- Potions apply their affect for a short duration to entities below\n- Liquid Fertilizer, a new fluid, applies a bonemeal affect to blocks.\n\nThe latter is meant to enable growing of _Banana Fonds_ from [Neapolitan][NEAPOLITAN] without being dependent on the weather, but it could possibly have other effects on other mods too.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/sprinkler.png)\n\n### Overweight Farming\n\nIf present, some compatibility features for [Overweight Farming][OVERWEIGHT_FARMING] is added.  \nThis includes waxing recipes using the deployer,\nas well as showing the axe-stripping of overweight crops in JEI.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/strip.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/SliceAndDice/1.20.x/screenshots/wax.png)\n","published":"2022-08-14T17:09:40.957018Z","updated":"2024-09-23T16:33:00.345171Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1118143,"followers":495,"categories":["food","technology"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["UJTc0pk2","1wP6CNfI","Nk2dO6Go","KriL1JFW","r4yDHtFN","tA385l8n","JH33REuT","tZZRCOac","lXNFlrvW","OIhe0uO4","ZmhTpjLR","pRwBOCJc","gCGCFJis","hPDyRNw3","lrslRK8c","fGG0Gjcv","mG1fIOia","akAH2F1g","89gCgL8n","FF8UA0pu","LfIs9gRN","PmCarZvQ","BZLiJ13y","O8bSqUaV","sGqyWl93","U9GIWHMX","uv6f7FCw","t8iOd0XR","7HTroPJk","kvrLbSxC","1aTrUinS","qWFV16cD","3wyhfJQQ","vd7c2RPJ","mTr2nUPj","t3lFXxzY","aRK21L9m","qaNqtys9","nkNOsYBR","rYnuEPwn","tAgVGTaW","s9l4uqVE","IlpHtI0z","ZEitGVtL","73nfCddX","etRuKHcg","yZ9zZESN","giM4WleV","ZgvbijiO","tz8HfyEB","BWLxCZmk","W15dmG2v","fIWeey09","GsUN2gpi","ZfE7RsnM","N8SSdoeZ","kgYlBrag","eBrGzRXM","spsGZIJQ","GDyNpDy7","86R8vw1P","liaYM4hX","2YFOoeUh","bKH5nqMk","BMPSTnHW","UdU72k1h","EzpVcwYV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/d2d4a1a5cfc7f1ececf50dc977021c62654ccdc8_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"EzpVcwYV","project_id":"GmjmRQ0A","author_id":"qxswSLtS","featured":false,"name":"Fabric 3.3.1","version_number":"3.3.1","changelog":"- fixed issue with new mixin (FORGE-169)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-09-23T16:33:01.066528Z","downloads":26264,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"0afb4988affe98b88122285f956d045f4e345aca25c16dd2c62b0d876f1ff21e0f613f2ab06399634ae32ed196ce888b6c7bb7df06c7e4b4a53713761a0fcc94","sha1":"2c146668d44d80af97df15f37165a3a5933b0308"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/GmjmRQ0A/versions/EzpVcwYV/sliceanddice-fabric-3.3.1.jar","filename":"sliceanddice-fabric-3.3.1.jar","primary":true,"size":563207,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"7vxePowz","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Xbc0uyRg","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"l7tsXKAD","user":{"id":"qxswSLtS","username":"possible_triangle","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12880806?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-06-13T20:35:57.654377Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"sliceanddice-fabric-3.3.1.jar"},"mods/RoughlyEnoughItems-12.1.785-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"1eaf6de6ba640407599767d150aa0c7dd71ad071915bf34d9a06fa8a0a3825882cd0fa966d3f225912f5fb456be38fe58021db9df988f65d667bea102a861a15","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"nfn13YXA","slug":"rei","project_type":"mod","team":"tVG3f9PC","title":"Roughly Enough Items (REI)","description":"Clean and Customizable.

Night Config integration for Auto Config.","body":"# Night Auto Config\n\nSerialize everything! **Night Auto Config** is a **[Night Config](https://github.com/TheElectronWill/Night-Config)** integration for **[Auto Config (now embedded in Cloth Config).](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**\n\n## Implementation\n\n**Night Auto Config** introduces a `NightConfigSerializer` to satisfy **Auto Config**'s requirement of a serializer's implementation. You can choose from all the available config formats of **Night Config,** and use the serializer just as other common serializers, even along with a `PartitioningSerializer`.\n\n### Add to Your Project\n\nIt is recommended to use **[JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#KessokuTeaTime/Night-Auto-Config)** to implement **Night Auto Config** into your project.\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Groovy</summary>\n\n<h6 align=\"right\">build.gradle</h6>\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n\tmaven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n\tmodApi \"com.github.KessokuTeaTime:Night-Auto-Config:${project.nightautoconfig_version}\"\n\t// You'll need to implement Cloth Config API here.\n}\n```\n\n<h6 align=\"right\">gradle.properties</h6>\n\n```\nnightautoconfig_version={latest}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Kotlin DSL</summary>\n\n<h6 align=\"right\">build.gradle.kts</h6>\n\n```kotlin\nrepositories {\n\tmaven { url = uri(\"https://jitpack.io\") }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n\tmodApi(\"com.github.KessokuTeaTime:Night-Auto-Config:${project.nightautoconfig_version}\")\n\t// You'll need to implement Cloth Config API here.\n}\n```\n\n<h6 align=\"right\">gradle.properties</h6>\n\n```\nnightautoconfig_version={latest}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n> You should replace `{latest}` with the latest [`tag name`](https://github.com/KessokuTeaTime/Night-Auto-Config/tags) of **Night Auto Config.**\n\n### Reference as Dependency\n\nDon't forget to reference **Night Auto Config** as dependency in your mod's metadata.\n\n<h6 align=\"right\">fabric.mod.json / quilt.mod.json</h6>\n\n```json\n{\n\t\"depends\": {\n\t\t\"nightautoconfig\": \"*\"\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe serializer implementation is at [`band.kessokuteatime.nightautoconfig.config.NightConfigSerializer`](https://github.com/KessokuTeaTime/Night-Auto-Config/blob/fabric/1.21/src/main/java/band/kessokuteatime/nightautoconfig/config/NightConfigSerializer.java).\n\nHere's a brief example:\n\n`MyConfig.java`\n```java\n// Use annotations provided by Night Auto Config to define serializer providers and deserializer providers at runtime!\n@SerializerProvider(MyClassSerializerProvider.class)\n@Config(name = \"my_config\")\npublic class MyConfig implements ConfigData {\n    // Something...\n    \n    private transient final Supplier<String> someStringProvider = () -> \"default\";\n    \n    // All Night Config annotations are available\n    @SerdeDefault(provider = \"someStringProvider\")\n    public String someString = someStringProvider.get();\n    \n    // Night Auto Config provides some interfaces for convenience implementations\n    // For example, `UnifiedSerializerProvider<T, R>` satisfies both `ValueSerializer<T, R>` and `ValueSerializerProvider<T, R>`\n    public static class MyClassSerializerProvider implements UnifiedSerializerProvider<MyClass, String> {\n        // ...\n    }\n    \n    // A custom serializer provider for `MyClass` is already specified at type definition\n    public MyClass someInstance = new MyClass();\n}\n```\n\n`MyMod.java`\n```java\npublic class MyMod implements ModInitializer {\n    @Override\n    public void onInitialize() {\n        // Don't remember to register into Auto Config at initialize\n        AutoConfig.register(NightExampleConfig.class, ConfigType.DEFAULT_COMMENTED::fileWatcherSerializer);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nFor runtime examples, checkout [this package.](https://github.com/KessokuTeaTime/Night-Auto-Config/blob/fabric/1.21/src/main/java/band/kessokuteatime/nightautoconfig/example/config)\n\n> Please annotate your fields with [`com.electronwill.nightconfig.core.serde.annotations.SerdeDefault`](https://github.com/TheElectronWill/night-config/blob/master/core/src/main/java/com/electronwill/nightconfig/core/serde/annotations/SerdeDefault.java) for basic compatibilities!

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

addon providing support for the Fabric Rendering API, based on Indigo","body":"Indium is an addon for the rendering optimisation mod [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), providing support for the Fabric Rendering API. The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19.

Say goodbye to wasting your well earned levels on random enchants, and welcome a world of choice with fair costs for you hard-working Minecrafters.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cATWWPwhay4\" height=\"480\" width=\"854\"></iframe></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The enchanting infuser offers everything you require for your enchanting needs: A <strong>grand selection of enchantments</strong> of course, a <strong>beautifully designed block with neat animations</strong>, an <strong>extremely useful and compact interface</strong> which even allows you to search for enchantments, and also direct <strong>access to your armor</strong> from within the interface.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The infuser comes in two versions: A basic one made from <strong>amethyst</strong>, and an advanced one made from <strong>netherite</strong>. The differences are quite substantial, so it might be a good idea to upgrade your infuser sooner than later: In addition to freshly enchanting items, the advanced infuser can also change enchantment levels, or even completely remove individual enchantments (curses are excluded from this). And that's not all! You can even use your experience levels to repair your tools. Furthermore both infusers differ in how they scale level costs, with the advanced version being quite a bit cheaper obviously.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">By default, the basic version <strong>requires around 30 levels</strong> to max out all enchantments for an item. In contrast to vanilla, you'll have to pay all those levels and not just a maximum of 3. This makes the cost much higher than going from level 27 to 30. The advanced infuser on the other hand is quite a bit less costly, <strong>requiring around 20</strong> levels at max. This is just a bit more than going from level 27 to 30 in the vanilla system.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">To work, the infuser <strong>requires bookshelves</strong> around it, just like the vanilla enchanting table. Most <strong>enchantments and higher enchantment levels require a certain amount</strong> to be unlocked. Place those bookshelves around the infuser with a gap of one block in two layers (at the infuser's level, and one block above it).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">The enchanting infuser <strong>does not offer treasure enchantments and curses</strong>, this means an enchantment which you can never obtain at a vanilla enchanting table will also not show up here. So you'll still have to use those cheesy librarians for your mending needs!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/407/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/409/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Both enchanting infuser versions looking extra sharp</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Choose which enchantments you want to put on your gear</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/410/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/411/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Select the enchantments you want and enchant your item</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Not all enchantments are compatible with each other</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/412/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/413/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Add more bookshelves to unlock enchantments and higher levels</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Helpful search and Enchantment Descriptions support</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/414/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/411/415/2021-11-29_19.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Crafting your first enchanting infuser</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Upgrading your infuser to the next level</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/OwxZhGM.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Forge?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Install my <span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod and do it directly in-game!</span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod on Fabric?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Editing configs directly in-game has not yet been implemented. Instead when in a world run the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command by choosing either <code>CLIENT</code> or <code>SERVER</code> (depending on the mod), then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to be able to manually edit the config file in a separate editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Fabric on versions of Minecraft before 1.19?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Older downloads are found on the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchanting-infuser-fabric\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>old project page</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Uhm, the enchantment costs are way too overpriced / way too cheap!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Don't worry, all parameters for calculating enchantment costs are exposed in the server config file. Simply edit them to your liking.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: What's this mysterious enchanting power my enchanting infuser keeps telling me about?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> That's simply the number of bookshelves surrounding the infuser. You can see how many you already have in the bottom-right corner.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I can't get the mending enchantment!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The enchanting infuser offers the same enchantment selection the vanilla enchanting table has. Special enchantments (e.g. mending and curses) can be enabled and configured in the server config though.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Does the enchanting infuser also support disenchanting and repairing?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, the advanced enchanting infuser can do this for you.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I don't get any levels back when disenchanting!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> You don't get levels, but you get experience points, the same amount as when using a grindstone. This is necessary due to how experience levels scale in Minecraft, otherwise you would potentially receive way more experience in levels than you've actually spent enchanting!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I enable the tooltips with enchantment descriptions?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The descriptions are provided by a separate mod: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchantment-descriptions\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Enchantment Descriptions</strong></span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/darkhaxdev\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Darkhax</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I'm using the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/apotheosis\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Apotheosis</strong></span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/shadows_of_fire\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Shadows_of_Fire</strong></span></a> which alters the enchanting system quite significantly. Are those changes compatible with my enchanting infuser?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, they are! When Apotheosis is installed, enchanting infusers will support higher levels for enchantments. Also costs will be significantly increased to better resemble Apotheosis' own enchanting mechanics. You'll also now have to use Apotheosis' more powerful bookshelves for your infuser to reach its full potential.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I don't like the infuser textures, do you have something that's more inline with vanilla's enchanting table?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Wow, that hurts. Nah, just kidding.

included via Jar-in-Jar to allow it to be removed from `fabric.mod.json`, which was causing issues in developement environments when Night Config wasn't retrieved from the official Maven, but instead production jars were used, e.g. from the Curse Maven\n- Note that Night Config is shaded without being relocated to a different package, which is necessary to stay consistent with Forge\n###

This is important!\n\nThe version support numbers are strict! <br>\nIf a version says it supports MC 1.18.1 it will NOT work on 1.18.2! <br>\n\nAnd: the mod is still in alpha. Things may change, break, crash or otherwise go wrong. You have been warned! <br>\nAlthough if you have problems feel free to leave an issue on the project's GitLab.\n<br> \n \n\n \n## FAQ:\n\n**Q: Forge or Fabric?** <br>\nA: MC 1.20.6 and newer - NeoForge and Fabric are both in the same jar. <br>\nMC 1.20.4 and older - Forge and Fabric are both in the same jar. \n\n**Q: Shaders?** <br>\nA: Yes, but only with certain shaders. <br>\n- Optifine: DH partially works with forward rendered shaders.\n- Iris (and equivalent ports): DH 2.1.0+ only works with Iris 1.7+ and only with shaders built with DH support in mind. \n  - DH 2.0 and older don't work with Iris.\n\n**Q: Does this work with player created structures?** <br>\nA: Yes.\n\n**Q: Is there multiplayer support?** <br>\nA: Yes.\nAlthough currently the mod is only client side so you have to explore chunks for the mod to use them.\n\n<br>\n\n### Extended FAQ:\n\n<a

own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.\n\n## About\n\nMelody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>\nIt allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.\n\nMelody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.\n\nIt has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing stopping you from extending it to support more file types!\n\nTo get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!\n\nEverything important is documented in the source, so make sure to take a look at [Melody's source on GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody)!\n\n## Copyright & Licensing\n\nMelody Copyright © 2023 Keksuccino.<br>\nMelody is licensed under MIT.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version! Note that this is for 1.19.2+ only.\n</p>\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/omRqM-gZBAg\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;

CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be.

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2024-07-15T11:03:13.629144Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":2908087,"followers":1478,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff","AHxQGtuC","7aQD4OG8","SGjPO8H9","JagCscwi"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"AHxQGtuC","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.2","version_number":"3.7.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T04:25:11.224830Z","downloads":1058621,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"bedf97c87c5e556416410267108ad358b32806448be24ef8ae1a79ac63b78b48b9c851c00c845b8aedfc7805601385420716b9e65326fdab21340e8ba3cc4274","sha1":"d58cc8759587f03f320f188972ca66baa788d008"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/AHxQGtuC/trinkets-3.7.2.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar","primary":true,"size":238532,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar"},"mods/xercapaint-fabric-1.20.1-1.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"37c0c1d288ebf9975a8b0ee8d5d9df366199110de2b06fe4bda7f91b0460a3cb3bf1351fa3cd9109d0f2441f0bc2bc641df53ec811dd54793deb7a2e177dd6da","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"YOs4tZea","slug":"joy-of-painting","project_type":"mod","team":"oAH7UMxc","title":"Joy of Painting","description":"This mod lets you craft a blank canvas and a palette, with which you can paint your own pictures and hang them on a wall like the vanilla paintings.","body":"<p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">This mod lets you craft a blank canvas and a palette, with which you can paint your own pictures and hang them on a wall like the vanilla paintings.

Right click with a palette to paint on an easel.</p>\n<p>Added <strong>importing/exporting</strong> paintings to a file using commands. (/paintexport &lt;filename&gt; and /paintimport &lt;filename&gt;)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can import/export paintings between worlds and servers.</li>\n<li>Paintings are imported from and exported to a \"paintings\" folder inside your minecraft directory.</li>\n<li>In order to import a painting in survival mode, you need to hold an empty canvas and a full palette on your hands.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Added a <strong>brush opacity</strong> meter. Using this, you can basically mix colors on the canvas itself!</p>\n<p>The canvas and palette in the GUI can now be <strong>moved</strong>. Move them out of the way to see your reference objects!</p>\n<p>Added helpful <strong>tooltips</strong> for some parts of the painting GUI (can be toggled on and off easily)</p>\n<p>Item textures are tweaked, palette texture now shows how many basic colors it has.</p>\n<p>The game now remembers the last color you had selected when you close the GUI, so you don't have to reselect it when you reopen it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>New in 1.16.4-1.1:</strong></h3>\n<p>There is now a <strong>color picker</strong> tool on <strong>full palettes</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Click its icon to switch to color picking</li>\n<li>Then click and hold to pick a color on the canvas and bring it to one of the custom color slots on the palette</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/2dcsjdZ/color-picker.gif\" alt=\"Color picker\" width=\"588\" height=\"331\"></p>\n<p>There are also some <strong>sound effects</strong> now, because it was too boring to paint in silence.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Usage Guide</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First you need to craft (or get from the creative inventory) a palette and a canvas. Crafting recipes are given below.</li>\n<li>When crafting a palette, any combination of dyes will do, but you need at least one dye.</li>\n<li>You can then fill the palette with other dyes if you want.</li>\n<li>There are currently four kinds of canvases. The basic one is 1 block sized. The others are 1x2, 2x1 and 2x2 block sized.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas (by itself) with right-click lets you view its content.</li>\n<li>Using a palette (by itself) lets you open the palette interface, where you can mix colors to create custom ones.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas in one hand and a palette on the other lets you open both interfaces at once, where you can paint on the canvas using the colors on your palette. You can mix colors here as well.</li>\n<li>Another option is to place the canvas on an easel and right click the easel with a palette at hand.</li>\n<li>The color mixing rules work the same way as the vanilla leather armor dyeing mechanic.</li>\n<li>Change the brush size or opacity with the mouse wheel or by clicking on the GUI element</li>\n<li>Undo mistakes with the CTRL+Z shortcut</li>\n<li>After painting a canvas, you can use it on a wall similar to vanilla paintings to hang it on the wall.</li>\n<li>Hitting the hanged canvas or breaking a block it rests on will drop it back as an item.</li>\n<li>Sign a painting to give it a name and make it unchangeable.</li>\n<li>Copy signed paintings by crafting them together with an empty canvas of the same shape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Vpf9MsM/canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"159\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7rwQHrr/long-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting long canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"142\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dByhxvw/tall-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting tall canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"145\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/26jnbYv/large-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a large canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\"></p>\n<p>To craft a palette, you need at least one kind of dye:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7Xy8959/palette-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\"></p>\n<p>You can fill an existing palette with other dyes later:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/L8V5BsS/palette-fill.png\" alt=\"Filling a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\"></p>\n<p>You can copy signed paintings:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/PW9LKrG/copying-recipe.png\" alt=\"Copying a signed painting\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\"></p>\n<h5>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Crafting an easel:</span></h5>\n<h5><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jWg0Xkx/java-zva-Bwzjr8-A.png\" alt=\"Easel recipe\" width=\"400\" height=\"178\"></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>About shaders:</h4>\n<p>The latest versions (1.18.2, 1.19.2 and above) seem to work fine with custom shaders, but there is no guarantee that it will work with every shader.

Here is a quick look through the changes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overhauled the music sheet GUI. Now it is a horizontal, scrolling sheet.</li>\n<li>You can now create <strong>MUCH longer</strong> music sheets. The upper limit is long enough to fit basically any music in a single sheet.</li>\n<li><strong>Note length</strong> is customizable! You can drag the mouse to set the length of each note.</li>\n<li>Multiple notes can be put at the same beat, and notes of different lengths can <strong>overlap</strong> in any way possible!</li>\n<li>TWICE the number of octaves. So, we are up from 4 to <strong>8 octaves</strong>. Note that not every instrument is suitable for every octave.</li>\n<li>Music sheets have a <strong>volume</strong> setting now.</li>\n<li>Each individual note also has a <strong>volume</strong> that can be set.</li>\n<li>Much more<strong> granular Tempo options</strong>, with an upper limit of 3000 BPM!</li>\n<li><strong>4</strong> <strong>new instruments</strong>: Redstone Guitar, Bass Guitar, Oboe and French Horn</li>\n<li>Advanced instrument playing GUI: You can now press <strong>multiple notes together</strong>, and <strong>releasing a key stops the note</strong>.</li>\n<li>Support for <strong>MIDI device input</strong> in the instrument GUI! Just connect your device and right click an instrument as normal.</li>\n<li>With 1.17.1-2.2, you can also use your MIDI device in the music sheet GUI as well! You can even record with it!</li>\n<li>The new record button in 1.17.1-2.2 allows you to<strong> record music in real time</strong> with your keyboard or a MIDI device.</li>\n<li>Middle clicking a note in the sheet GUI lets you view its <strong>real life notation</strong> name and edit it.</li>\n<li>Customizable <strong>measure lines</strong> in the music sheet GUI, for visual aid.</li>\n<li><strong>CTRL+Z to undo</strong> in the sheet GUI.</li>\n<li>A <strong>help button</strong> in the sheet GUI that explains the controls and keyboard shortcuts.</li>\n<li>Storage and network for the music sheets are handled more smartly now, consuming <strong>less resources</strong> than before, regardless of the length of a music.</li>\n<li>Loading an old world will <strong>automatically update</strong> all old music sheets to the new format on load. This is <strong>irreversible, </strong>so backup your world if you might want to play in an older version of the mod.</li>\n<li>Old copied musics can still be pasted in the new version (but not vice versa).</li>\n<li>Old exported sheet files can be imported in the new version (but not vice versa).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"color: #f00;\"><strong>Note: </strong></span>If updating from an older version, I suggest you backup your world (or at least just the music sheets) before updating, in case there is a problem with the update process.</p>\n<hr><hr>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Features (before the huge update)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;Music sheets that let you create music</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Sounds follow the chromatic scale with 12 notes per octave and&nbsp;4 octaves for a total of 48 notes</li>\n<li>&nbsp;11 different tempo settings from 60 BPM to 1200 BPM</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Writing music with the mouse or the keyboard, whichever you find comfortable</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Convenient keyboard functionality such as space, delete, backspace</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Selecting, copying and pasting notes. CTRL + A, CTRL + C, CTRL + V shortcuts work.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Copying between different sheets and even outside Minecraft. You can copy them to a text file to back up or paste in another world/server.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Putting up to 5 sheets in the hotbar to see and preview multiple layers of music at the same time when editing. Neighboring sheets can easily be disabled with a button that appears.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Previewing sheets with an instrument in the off hand. You can also lock the instrument per sheet to only preview with that instrument even when your off hand item changes. This can be used to mark which instrument a sheet is supposed to be played with and is also useful with neighboring sheets previews.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;13 craftable instruments and 1 instrument that can be found in certain treasures.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Using an instrument by itself plays a random note.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Using an instrument while holding a sheet with your offhand plays the sheet to the world.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Music boxes take in a sheet and an instrument. They start (or stop if playing already) playing when they take in a redstone signal that goes from off to on.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Music boxes also send a one second redstone pulse to their right face when they finish playing. This can be used to chain songs or activate piece of a contraption.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Metronomes supply a steady ticking when the redstone signal is on. The ticking rate can be set with a right click or using a music sheet on the metronome.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;After four tickings of a metronome, all nearby players that hold a music sheet with the correct tempo and an instrument will start playing synchronously. Use this to play songs together with your band.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Keyboard usage is as shown:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/VvVz169/music-mod-keyboard.png\" alt=\"Keyboard Bindings\"

Preview","description":"Allows you to preview a map / seed in the new world screen","body":"# World Preview\n\n*World Preview* is a mod for visualizing Minecraft world seeds before they are generated.\n\n## Installation\n\nJust download the latest *World Preview* JAR file for your ***exact*** Minecraft version.\nAdditionally, ***always*** ensure that you are using the correct version for your modloader (Fabric/Forge).\nThen save the downloaded jar to the `mods` folder of your Minecraft instance.\n\nFinally, if you are on Fabric you also need to download the\n[Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).\n\n## Usage\n\n*World Preview* adds a new `Preview` tab to the Singleplayer menu.\n\n<img alt=\"biomes\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/open.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nUpon opening that tab, a random seed is selected and a map of biomes is generated:\n\n<img alt=\"biomes\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/biomes.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nBy default, the overworld dimension will be generated, structures will not be shown and no heightmap will be generated.\nThis can be changed in the Settings (top-left button in the `Preview` tab).\n\nWhen structure sampling is enabled, the visibility of individual types of structures on the preview can be toggled:\n\n<img alt=\"structures\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/structures.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nWhen height sampling is enabled, the preview can be toggled between the biome map and a colorized heightmap:\n\n<img alt=\"heightmap\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/heightmap.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nWhen y-layer intersection sampling is enabled, the preview can also show the blocks on the current y-layer.\nAdditionally, the y-layer one step below is also shown in a lighter color:\n\n<img alt=\"heightmap\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/y-int.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\nSince version 1.1.0, there is also experimental support for opening the preview in-game for a single-player worlds:\n\n<img alt=\"ingame\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/1.20/img/ingame.png\" width=\"100%\"/>\n\n##### Moving on the preview\n\nClicking and dragging on the map-part of the preview tab will move along the x and z axis.\nThis will cause the following load sequence:\n- Any biomes that are not yet sampled on the current y-level\n- Structures (if enabled)\n- Height map (if enabled)\n- Adjacent y-layers (if enabled)\n\nScrolling does **not** zoom into the map (there is a separate setting in the configuration menu for controlling the zoom level), but instead travels along the y-axis.\nThis allows cave biomes to be seen as well. Please note that non-cave biomes span the entire world height beyond that.\n\n##### Other features\n\n- Works with mods! Tested with:\n  - Terralith\n  - Biomes O' Plenty\n- Persistent seed storage\n- Highlighting specific biomes\n- Highly configurable and extendable\n\n## Supported version\n\nThis table shows the current support status for the Minecraft version.\n\n| Minecraft Version | Status    |\n|-------------------|-----------|\n| `1.20.x`          | Supported |\n\n## FAQ\n\n**Q:** *Will Minecraft versions before 1.20 be supported?*\n\n**A:** No.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *Will Multiplayer be supported?*\n\n**A:** No.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *Scrolling does not zoom the preview!*\n\n**A:** Scrolling moves the y-level up and down. To change the zoom level, go to `Settings (top left wrench) -> Resolution` and change the visual size of a chunk.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *The preview is completely white / black for the y-intersections view.*\n\n**A:** This is likely because the starting y-layer for the preview is the build limit. Try scrolling down to a lower y-layer and something should show up.\n\n---\n\n**Q:** *My CPU is at 100%!*\n\n**A:** You can limit the number of used cores in `Settings (top left wrench) -> General`. By default, *World Preview* tries to compute the biome preview / structures / heightmap as quickly as possible. These calculations require a lot of CPU power.\n\n\n\n## Mod incompatibilities\n\nThis mod should be compatible with most mods (including those adding new biomes and dimensions).\n\n### TerraFirmaCraft (TFC)\n\nWorld Preview **is** compatible with TFC, however, there is a known issue:\n\nThe Y intersections view will always be a white screen for all Y levels with TFC, because the `TFCChunkGenerator` has a dummy implementation for the [`getBaseColumn`](https://github.com/TerraFirmaCraft/TerraFirmaCraft/blob/v3.1.2-beta/src/main/java/net/dries007/tfc/world/TFCChunkGenerator.java#L643-L646) method.\n\nTo clarify: This doesn't mean that TFC is broken / does something wrong (it clearly works on its own and does its job).\nIt just means that TFC does not provide the specific information World Preview needs in this case.\n\n## Adding support for new biomes and structures\n\nNew biomes, structures, and more can be registered via the Minecraft datapack mechanism. See [the World Preview dataformat docs](https://github.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/blob/1.20/DataFormats.md) for more information.\n","published":"2023-07-20T17:55:05.364950Z","updated":"2024-09-05T16:06:04.029219Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":89126,"followers":302,"categories":["utility","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","quilt"],"versions":["tjqMno0Q","D5XR5WmI","uMb9JQJJ","EYQTvcon","q8cp8Up8","KcOX4y1R","lrmzvajm","LfhhSGYb","AgDtzd65","WsxbjtV1","5dgT6Hzz","nSPYf7G7","urkq3DFQ","o1bxdh0N","Q94LMYhZ","8myO4JQ4","JJzfHWi8","3ypYT1wx","M4Ec8lMV","r1xyx71y","VxQspdgZ","j2jo2y0K","5W28SUks","Pob15K1q","40gp6QRO","9Xsy36AH","iAgxbkcC","5Ibk6yb4","9eJezYnQ","weSRpaMI","6g6HM0rx","ulplldFu","gisvN9Ni","391LqFNJ","6y1WrZlx","QEXJAQgM","k7Zr1mo0","lSCY5eo1","N4QTQdRQ","DORsov6y","Kj0zM7Oj","AMpckQBu","uW9H3vGv","qFulHiZp","wfQ6UKvb","VIKaUBvX","1XpQtOGc","wxxTL6mt","ZwhkWtxC","JI798WaO","RtwNAkCe","RocrdF9Y","Fj0yDznw","vtlcpSvx","nG5pru0W","3po8WTeW","YVpg2yFA","mTEkak34","yfupjTKn","fOphnFjx","QQQzLnFB","qdqTy35t","Cqx5za6o","c1ebMJ8t","9c4lZXOG","Jb7rFzWK","8iUo85YO","4kUQaI4S","qc0AtV3T","j0XQjyV4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WtfpyicL/d3abefcbeb5849d7744c71b09fe97e79e6f0362d.png"},"version":{"id":"QQQzLnFB","project_id":"WtfpyicL","author_id":"ywiTouYP","featured":false,"name":"World Preview 1.3.1","version_number":"1.3.1","changelog":"### ✨ Features\n\n-  Portuguese translation by [WingFrosty](https://github.com/WingFrosty)\n-  Russian translation update by [mpustovoi](https://github.com/mpustovoi)\n\n### 🐛 Bug Fixes\n\n-  Fixed generation when all chunks were sample at once [[#41]](https://github.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/issues/41)\n-  Fixed the calculation for the Peaks and Valley noise value to use weirdness instead of depth [[#42]](https://github.com/caeruleusDraconis/world-preview/issues/42)\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-09-02T15:30:07.194002Z","downloads":6136,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"25a4dc965fe7d04ab2cdf228149b46d19d2d6a2f189ecd0bfb73a2d77e5bc15905c5d13fbf63d4912104c8856bbcaa96a348b6355b9b4e54e58ff5af870d01c3","sha1":"1822951d8694f69b9b722165955549995c00df09"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WtfpyicL/versions/QQQzLnFB/world_preview-fabric-1.20.1-1.3.1.jar","filename":"world_preview-fabric-1.20.1-1.3.1.jar","primary":true,"size":374837,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"coUWYqBn","user":{"id":"Lr5PBqZM","username":"Taiterio","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10282898?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-27T15:14:38.252533Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"coUWYqBn","user":{"id":"ywiTouYP","username":"caeruleusDraconis","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108017831?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-06-22T19:30:37.454558Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"world_preview-fabric-1.20.1-1.3.1.jar"},"mods/YetAnotherConfigLib-3.6.1+1.20.1-fabric.jar":{"sha512":"b3fa9eb67f853535e32260af86e51c751f232809a1a7f4cae8f90344aed8862609d93e0c6e0fbb6ec89625dbde1fe30245585d710112c8c421780589d323cf1d","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"1eAoo2KR","slug":"yacl","project_type":"mod","team":"Nwpe87D0","title":"YetAnotherConfigLib (YACL)","description":"A builder-based configuration library for Minecraft.","body":"# YetAnotherConfigLib\n\n![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)\n[![Java 17](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Java%2017-9B599A.svg?color=orange)](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-releases-java-17-2021-09-14)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/780023008668287017?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/1eAoo2KR?color=00AF5C&label=downloads&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)\n[![CurseForge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_667299_downloads.svg)](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yacl)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/isxander)\n\nYet Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Features\n\nYACL has a ton of configuration features:\n\n- Custom control widgets\n  - Create your own unique \"controller\" if the default set does not suit your needs\n- Rich descriptions\n  - Clickable & hoverable text, powered by vanilla's Text component system\n  - WebP (including animated) image previews\n  - Custom rich-renderable section to replace image\n- Multiple controllers for the same type:\n  - Sliders or fields for numbers\n  - Dropdowns, cyclers, or raw text fields for strings\n  - Tickboxes or ON/OFF text display for booleans\n  - ...and more!\n- Fully-featured color picker\n- Accessible with full compatibility for keyboard control (optimised for Controlify usage)\n- High organisation with tabs (categories) and collapsable groups\n- Built-in serialization/deserialization techniques so you can skip the error-prone config code\n- Full alternative Kotlin DSL\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![image

Just press left click when cooking anything on a skillet or use a shovel on a placed down one!\n\n**🌽 Description**\n\n**Farmer's Delight** is a mod that gently expands upon farming and cooking in Minecraft.\n\nUsing a simple cooking system and a few familiar ingredients, you'll be able to prepare a wide variety of hearty meals: from sandwiches to salads and stews, from beautiful desserts to mouth-watering feasts, no ingredient will be left behind in your kitchen!\n\nIt also introduces a rich set of utilities: a way to **improve the very soil** your crops grow in, a brand new kind of tool to **scavenge resources** with, cute **decorations** for your builds, and many blocks and items to help you on your adventure!\n\nIt's time to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n \n**📖 Getting Started**\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) to help you learn the basics!\n\n \n**📝 FAQ**\n<details>\n<summary>Expand for FAQ</summary>\n\n**Q. How does this different from the other existing Farmer's Delight Fabric?**\n\nA. This port's main focus has been on simplicity and faithfulness to the original mod. This meant that only minor changes were made to accommodate the loader specific things.\n\nPackage names and all existing behavior has been kept the same. This means that FD addons can now easily be ported from Forge to Fabric with, ideally, no change at all as all the package names are the same.\n\n[A list of differences can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Differences.md)\n\n**Q. Will existing addons work for this?**\n\nA. While porting existing Forge addons to Fabric will be trivial, already existing Fabric addons made for the old Fabric port will NOT work and they will have to update to reflect the new package structure.\n\n[A list of supported addons and integrations can be found here.](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/FarmersDelight/blob/1.20/information/Addons_And_Integrations.md)\n\nFeel free to ask for more compat layers, however, they will only be done if they are simple enough to be able to be done, anything more complicated and you're best to wait for a developer to support Farmer's Delight Refabricated or just accept that they might not, it's really up to them.\n\n**Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?**\n\nA. Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n\n- Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n- Always read the changelogs! Minor and major versions can sometimes have breaking changes, which will be explained there.\n\n**Q. Will I keep old blocks from the other FD port?**\n\nA. The mods use the same IDs so yes.\n\n**Q. Will addons for the other port be updated to use this one instead?**\n\nA. That depends on them. Updating/porting a Forge addon is trivial but this will still take a bit of time and depends on the individual modder. So please be patient and don't harrass modders.\n\n**Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?**\n\nA. Farmer's Delight Refabricated is currently being updated for 1.20+. Any other versions are currently discontinued.\n\n**Q. Are you going to backport this mod to versions before 1.15?**\n\nA. No. This mod will never be backported to older versions.

You shouldn't need to download it alone.*\n\n#### Commands\n\n* `/surveyor` - display information about your map exploration, including sharing.\n* `/surveyor share [username]` - request/accept sharing map exploration with a player.\n* `/surveyor unshare` - stop sharing map exploration (leave your \"sharing group\")\n* `/surveyor landmarks` - view a cross-world landmark breakdown by type.\n* `/surveyor landmarks get [type]` - lists each landmark of that type in the current world.\n* `/surveyor landmarks remove [type] [pos]` removes a waypoint or landmark (op 2) from the world.\n* `/surveyor landmarks add [type] [pos] [name]` add a waypoint to the world at the specified position.\n* `/surveyor landmarks global [type] [pos] [name]` (op 2) add a landmark to the world at the specified position.\n\n#### Configuration\n\nSurveyor has extensive start-time configuration in `config/surveyor.toml`.<br/>\nIt's various systems can be turned on and off, and map sharing tweaked finely.\n\n---\n\n### Library Features\n\n**Surveyor relieves the scanning, saving, and networking responsibilities from dependent map mods.**\n\nIn general, Surveyor:\n\n* Records terrain, structure, and \"landmark\" data suitable for maps as the world is changed.\n* Enables live map sharing between players by tracking individual exploration of the map.\n* Sends the client structures as they're discovered or shared.\n* Syncs map data and landmarks (e.g. waypoints) when sharing or on client data loss.\n* Exposes a generic API for map mod integrations (e.g. adding map markers to important locations).\n* Only adds 2-5% to save size, using an efficient format both in-memory and on-disk.\n\nSurveyor's data **deliberately preserves key details**, designed to allow any abitrary map mod to use it:\n\n* Terrain is a top-down view of blocks with height, biome, light level, and water depth.\n* Terrain contains multiple layers, allowing for usable cave and nether maps.\n* Structures have IDs, pieces, tags, and even full piece NBT for smaller structures intact.\n* Landmarks generically represent other positional map data - e.g. waypoints, POIs, or faction claims.\n\n---\n\n**Notice: Surveyor is still in early releases.**\n\n* The API might break several times during 0.x\n* The networking format will break several times during 0.x.\n* The save format will likely break on the change to 1.x\n* Javadoc is very limited\n\n---\n\n## Developers\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n\tmaven { url 'https://repo.sleeping.town/' }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n\tmodImplementation 'folk.sisby:surveyor:0.3.0+1.20'\n\tinclude 'folk.sisby:surveyor:0.3.0+1.20'\n}\n```\n\n#### Examples\n\n* **[Antique Atlas 4](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas)** - A stylized client-side map mod.\n* **[SurveyorSurveyor](https://github.com/HestiMae/surveyor-surveyor)** - An enhanced-vanilla style java map image generator, using raw surveyor save files.\n* **[Surveystones](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-fwaystones)** - A mixed-side addon that automatically adds landmarks for waystones from [Fabric Waystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/fwaystones/versions).\n\n### Core Concepts\n\nThe **World Summary** holds all of surveyor's data for a world. It can be accessed using `WorldSummary.of(World)`.\n\n**Chunk Summaries** (or the \"Terrain Summary\") represent the world viewed from above. This includes the top layer of blocks, along with their biome, height, block light level, and the depth of water above them.\n\n**Structure Summaries** represent an in-world structure (called `StructureStart` in yarn) - they include map-critical information for identifying the structure and its pieces, even full NBT for structures with under 10 pieces, but not any actual blocks.\n\n**Landmarks** are a way to represent all other positional information on-map. They have unique serialization per-type, and are uniquely keyed by their type and position to prevent overlaps.\n\n**Exploration** is a record of what chunks, structures, and landmarks a player should be able to see.<br/>\nA player explores a chunk when they're sent it, explores a structure when they stand in (or look at) one of its pieces, and explores an (unowned) landmark when they explore the chunk it's in.\n\n### Terrain Summary Layers\n\nTo facilitate cave mapping, Surveyor records the top layer of blocks at **multiple height levels** (layer heights).\n\n**The Overworld** scans for floors in these layers:\n\n* 257-319 - usually empty\n* 62-256 - surface terrain\n* 0-61 - sea floors and riverbeds, ravines, and caves\n* -64-0 - deepslate caves\n\n**The Nether** scans for floors in these layers:\n\n* 127-255 - usually flat bedrock\n* 71-126 - high caves and outcrops\n* 41-70 - mid-level outcrops and walkways\n* 0-40 - the lava sea and shores\n\nRoughly speaking, Surveyor will accept any non-clear solid block below a 2-high walk-space as a floor.<br/>\nIt will also detect \"carpets\" (non-clear non-solid blocks) above these floors and use those instead.\n\nSurveyor supports any layer height configuration, but currently lacks the API/config to change this for specific dimensions.\n\nNote that the amount of layers doesn't affect how mods display the map, only how often cave floors will be occluded by floors above them.\n\n### Map Mods\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the map mod guide</summary>\n\nQuick reminder that surveyor should **replace any existing world scanning logic**<br/>\nYou should never need to look at the currently loaded chunks - If some information is missing, let us know!\n\n#### Initial Setup\n\nClient map mods should always use `SurveyorClientEvents` - this ensures only explored areas will be provided in singleplayer.\n\nTune into `WorldLoad` and queue up the provided keys for rendering.<br/>\nThis event will trigger when the client world has access to surveyor data and the player is available.\n\n`terrain` contains all available chunks by region. `WorldTerrainSummary.toKeys()` converts this into ChunkPos.<br/>\n`structures` contains all structure starts by key + ChunkPos.<br/>\n`landmarks` contains all landmarks (POIs, waypoints, death markers, etc.) by type + BlockPos.\n\nYou can get these from the world summary later using `keySet()` methods - check the event implementation.<br/>\nPass in `SurveyorClient.getExploration()` to ensure unexplored areas are hidden.\n\n##### Live Updates\n\nAlso tune into `TerrainUpdated`, `StructuresAdded`, `LandmarksAdded` to add to your render queues.<br/>\nThese fire whenever the client player should see something new (usually via exploration).<br/>\nThey can also fire before `ClientPlayerLoad`, so let any of them create your map data.\n\nTune into `LandmarksRemoved` as well but without a queue - just remove from your map/queue directly.\n\n#### Terrain Rendering\n\nFirst, generate a top layer (with any desired height limits) using `get(ChunkPos).toSingleLayer()`.<br/>\nThis will produce a raw layer summary of one-dimensional arrays:\n\n* **exists** - True where a floor exists, false otherwise - where false, all other fields are junk.\n* **depths** - The distance of the floor below your specified world height. so y = worldHeight - depth.\n* **blocks** - The floor block. Indexed per-region via `getBlockPalette(ChunkPos)`.\n* **biomes** - The floor biome. Indexed per-region via `getBiomePalette(ChunkPos)`.\n* **lightLevels** - The block light level directly above the floor (i.e. the block light for its top face). 0-15.\n* **waterLights** - The block light level directly above the water's surface (if there is one). 0-15.\n* **waterDepths** - How deep the contiguous water above the floor is.\n\t* All other liquid surfaces are considered floors, but water is special-cased.\n\t* The sea floor (e.g. sand) is recorded, and this depth value indicates the water surface instead.\n\t* This allows maps to show water depth shading, but also hide water completely if desired.\n\nAll arrays can be indexed by `x * 16 + z`, where x and z are relative to the chunk.<br/>\nUse these arrays to render and store map data for that chunk (pixels, buffers, whichever).<br/>\nRemember that you'll be rendering hundreds of thousands of chunks here - optimize this process hard.\n\n#### Structure Rendering\n\nAlong with the key and ChunkPos, you can get the type and any tags using `getType(key)` and `getTags(key)`.\n\nYou can access a full summary of the structure (e.g. to draw its bounding boxes) using `get(key, ChunkPos)`.<br/>\nThis includes piece data like boxes, direction, IDs, etc.\n\n#### Landmark Rendering & Management\n\nAlong with the type and BlockPos, you can get a full landmark using `get(type, BlockPos)`.\n\nBy default, this can include a dye color, a text name, the owner's UUID, and a texture (could be from another map mod).<br/>\nYou should have a method of rendering a landmark using just this information.\n\nTo improve how landmarks are displayed, you can use `instanceof` to check for additional data, e.g. `HasBlockBox`.\n\nTo add a waypoint landmark, just make a `SimplePointLandmark` owned by the player and use `put(Landmark)`.<br/>\nThis will save to disk and send a copy to the server.\n\n#### Player Rendering\n\nYou can use `SurveyorClient.getFriends()` to get a set of players to draw on the map.\n\nThis includes both the client player, online \"friends\" (map sharing group members), and offline friends.\n\nThe players are represented abstractly, providing UUID, username, global position, yaw, and online status.\n\n</details>\n\n### Landmark Integrations\n\n<details>\n<summary>Click to show the landmark integration guide</summary>\n\nLandmark types can be registered via the registry in `Landmarks`.<br/>\nThis allows you to set and serialize custom data relevant to your landmark.<br/>\nYour landmark can usually be a record. Check the [builtins](https://github.com/sisby-folk/surveyor/tree/1.20/src/main/java/folk/sisby/surveyor/landmark) for an example.\n\nTo make extra landmark data accessible to map mods, always declare a new `Has` interface to access it from.\n\nTo place a landmark, just use `WorldSummary.of(world).landmarks().put(Landmark)`.<br/>\nThis works fine on either side - adding a landmark on the server will send it to the client and vice-versa.\n\nLandmark types can't yet have fallback types - so use a simple type (or PR a new one!) if your mod is only on one side.\n\n</details>\n\n## Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\n**Special thanks to:**<br/>\n[Ampflower](https://github.com/Ampflower), [Falkreon](https://github.com/falkreon), [Garden](https://modrinth.com/user/GardenSystem), [Kat](https://git.sleeping.town/Kat), [Solo](https://github.com/solonovamax), [Crosby](https://github.com/RacoonDog), [Lemma](https://github.com/LemmaEOF), [Leo](https://github.com/leo60228), [Jasmine](https://github.com/jaskarth), [Aqua](https://github.com/Aquaeyes), [Wonder](https://git.sleeping.town/wonder), [Infinidoge](https://github.com/Infinidoge), [Emi](https://github.com/emilyploszaj), and [Una](https://github.com/unascribed).\n\nWe're open to better ways to implement our mods.

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

This, when applied to all entities, does indeed speed up performance, whether it be a small bit or a noticeable bit, depending on the surrounding entities and your PC.","published":"2022-07-28T02:09:34.583501Z","updated":"2023-05-13T03:38:44.767420Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":1769979,"followers":633,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["nxnZwtrr","wpjsvepd","yvAsQAfN","dDeGyaOG","mYGanPjG","u2P8WuwJ","lrnG23SV","kipvKTOY","9zQlAOJO","uJqPZ41e","dXcNDUia","FBISH1pC","LCHmWNvu","uralQ5Oz","xxuvnms3","5lHXCowj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/yHf7SALy/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"5lHXCowj","project_id":"yHf7SALy","author_id":"2TIVL5E6","featured":true,"name":"1.6 (1.20)","version_number":"1.6-1.20","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-05-13T03:38:46.076762Z","downloads":1546270,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"0e611399323878b9f3efcc6016ea5d6eefc8c765","sha512":"6e4dca503f0952e18c07175d2281c8f2a2d8227939457646a8de0ce1ac72cf83861667f45e91c703629e1a9594c28ccc93cd3a74641ecf885fbcce5d10e13338"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/yHf7SALy/versions/5lHXCowj/lunade-fastanim-1.6-1.20.jar","filename":"lunade-fastanim-1.6-1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":118384,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"y41rtLTY","user":{"id":"2TIVL5E6","username":"Lunade_","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/87103914?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-25T21:32:15.110086Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"lunade-fastanim-1.6-1.20.jar"},"mods/ctov-create-structures-1.0.jar":{"sha512":"105e53ae17a14f918c88f47a0465ad836f3000073813b5538bf9b5f72204050106d8d0813561c466306d16a76b6030c1394543968588d8dba8c19b972e9c3895","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"l9fldtN4","slug":"ctov-create-structures","project_type":"mod","team":"VItKuuAE","title":"CTOV - Create: Structures","description":"Compatibility datapack between ChoiceTheorem's overhauled village and Create:Structures mod","body":"Add this datapack to the game to add compatibility between CTOV and Create:Structures.

This is done by taking advantage of multiple CPU cores in parallel. For the best performance it is recommended to use C2ME with [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [ScalableLux](https://modrinth.com/mod/scalablelux).\n\n## What does C2ME stand for?\nConcurrent chunk management engine, it's about making the game better threaded and more scalable in regard to world gen and chunk io performance.\n\n## So what is C2ME not?\n**C2ME is currently in alpha stage and pretty experimental.**  \nAlthough it is usable in most cases and tested during build time, it doesn't mean that it is fully stable for a production server.  \nSo backup your worlds

player's body stationary.\n-   **Free Adjustment of Camera Position**\n    -   While holding `Z`, moving the mouse adjusts the camera offset (the player's position on the screen), and the mouse wheel adjusts the distance between the camera and the player\n    -   **Quick Switching of Camera Offset (Left|Center|Right)** Short press `CapsLock` to toggle between left and right. Hold `CapsLock` to center the camera\n-   **Smart Aim Mode** Automatically switches to aim mode based on the item the player is holding and its using status. Rules can be customized. So it can be compatible with items from other mods\n-   **Shooting like first-person** When aiming at enemies in third-person, it predicts the target entity you want to shoot at, allowing you to simply place the crosshair above the enemy as if in first-person\n-   **Player Transparency** When the player entity obstructs the view, it becomes semi-transparent (May not be compatible with Sodium. This feature is disabled by default)\n-   **Smooth Perspective Switching** Smooth transition between first and third person perspectives\n-   **Disable Anytime** If the mod causes issues, you can disable it anytime in-game through the configuration menu or hotkey, reverting to the original third-person perspective\n-   **Client Side Only** No need to install on server. So you can join servers with this mod.\n\n<div align=center>\n\n## Links\n\n[Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/leawind-third-person)  \n[Q&A](https://github.com/Leawind/Third-Person/discussions/categories/q-a)  \n[My Donate Page](https://leawind.github.io/Third-Person/en-US/donate)\n\n</div>\n","published":"2023-12-30T11:02:47.572372Z","updated":"2024-10-09T16:30:05.361543Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":124002,"followers":273,"categories":["adventure"],"additional_categories":["utility"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["DlmCvPUL","dBE8RPdO","Go6RgMO4","OCW9TYer","NHXmhWPP","7CArIvyf","6egDqaiZ","rOFCno5E","Un6pa2fz","8hZ2KfI2","BqlS8bkF","WkuEw5H9","tIGfm5BE","ofBzdJ87","8hNKzDa1","kd1FqTce","5ZcweW7U","FSGfqdKF","F2VUDQdW","Pugiqs8J","k9trDVSh","PbffcXGA","bFsbtmcl","Cvfv26K0","ztLwPmjE","4X0fTn7i","K7HFarPo","JWjaPOq6","6sqcHl2C","rzLjZWhe","g7KaeO2T","pv6h7heV","rjBbfhNz","HNP9GMRl","w8kSyMIL","zhbrgwFK","4twnFkOR","tg5sd6dJ","v5b43s9i","BsuVKwnc","yNWAcJJ4","4Lhd7OCe","FpMWyfkZ","oL7BSvUD","mQSrw5Rh","HiRjc4NG","2Ejq6IrJ","6rQQRcr9","D5LP0p0B","HNy6rSFu","oZSHktmM","oYVH29Z4","mGMiIFEI","R5ME0eJB","z0rgBQzB"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/S3D3QF0M/707a25d3fcf17f6aa7009dd3d3bcb68ed7aa10e1_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"z0rgBQzB","project_id":"S3D3QF0M","author_id":"X5cTa8Op","featured":false,"name":"2.2.0-beta.1-mc1.20-1.20.1-fabric","version_number":"2.2.0-beta.1","changelog":"### Added\n\n* Add config: `camera_distance_mode`\n* Allow item tag in item pattern\n* Make it always use post effect of attached entity in spectator mode\n* Disable double-tap sprinting in third person by default #153 #155\n\t* config: `allow_double_tap_sprint`\n\n### Changed\n\n* Support both 1.20 and 1.20.1\n* Config `use_camera_pick_in_creative`:\n\t* Disabled by default\n\t* Moved to category _Other_\n\n### Removed\n\n* Remove config `sprint_impulse_threshold`\n\n### Fixed\n\n* Camera slightly shakes when hitting wall\n\n### Other\n\n* Change package name to `com.github.leawind.thirdperson`\n* Record stack trace when infinite value detected.

brass you are able to upgrade your copper backtank to a jetpack, \nusing the pressurized air inside to propel yourself through the air.\n\nInspired by [Simply Jetpacks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simply-jetpacks-2),\nthis jetpack also has a hover mode.\n\nLike the copper backtank, the jetpack does also go in the chest slot, \nfeeds air to items like the extendo-grip and can be enchanted with _Capacity_.\nJust like the backtank it is charged by placing it down and supplying it with rotational force.\n\n![Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/usage.png)\n\nWhen underwater while sprint-swimming, the jetpack boosts your swimming speed.\nAdditionally, the hover-mode prevents you from floating downwards.\n\n![Underwater Usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/underwater.png)\n\nIf a mod similar to [Elytra Slot](https://github.com/illusivesoulworks/elytraslot), \nwhich enables equipping an elytra in addition to a chestplate, \nthe jetpack will instead give you firework-like boost while the player is pressing the `UP`-key.\n\n![Elytra Support](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PssbleTrngle/CreateJetpack/1.19.x/screenshots/elytra.png)\n\nCurios Support is possible by adding it via a datapack.

This key is configurable in the key binds menu.\n- As of version 1.2.0, you can quickly toggle the light overlay on or off using `F8`! This key is configurable in the key binds menu.\n- As of version 1.3.0, you can change the \"red\"/\"orange\" threshold in the new config menu (accessible using `F7`). Useful for those that want to light their places up aesthetically, or maybe you are playing with some mods that change the mobs spawning rules.\n\n## Meaning of colors:\n - Green: No mobs can spawn here!\n - Orange: If the sun goes down, Mobs will spawn!

This was fixed using a better mixin location.\r\n- Lighty now correctly reports as an client side mod, so that a server which doesn't have Lighty doesn't mark the client as potentially incompatible.\r\n\r\n## Further information\r\n\r\nNow that the summer break has begun, I will have some more time for developing Lighty again!
