Configure the options, keybinds and server list as you would like them to be shipped in the modpack\n2. Join any world and run \"/defaultoptions saveAll\" to save your current options in the defaultoptions folder (located in the config folder where it should remain)\n3.

It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it

potions.\nTo get the potions recipes in-game use a tool like JEI. \n\n![mod banner](https://i.imgur.com/vTuMJt2.png)  \n\n## Requirements\n  \nThe mod depends on a reasonably recent version of the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api).  \n\n## Optional integrations\n\n- When [Trinkets](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets) is installed, rings will work in the ring slot.  \n- When [Pehkui](https://modrinth.com/mod/Pehkui) is installed, size changing potions will be added to the game too.  \n- Inventorio's inventory is supported (not on Modrinth)\n- The mod provides a [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) book. The book is still WIP and has no recipe, but you can get and read it in creative mode  \n- [NoMoreGlowingPotions](https://modrinth.com/mod/nomoreglowingpots) is highly suggested to appreciate the actual potion colors, instead of the weird glowing effect that makes them all look the same.  \n\n## Potions and Recipes\n  \n  \nEvery single potion recipe can be individually disabled in the config file.  \nAll potions in this mod are brewed in the vanilla Brewing Stand with vanilla items and have the standard splash, lingering and arrow variants; some of them may also have redstone and glowstone enhancements.  \nNot all potions are available in fabric yet. I'm slowly working on it, don't worry!  \n \n## Brewing Stand Tweak\n  \n  \nThere are two kind of people in this world, those who like the blaze powder requirement for brewing stands, and those who don't. I belong to the latter. A config now allows brewing stands to be powered by a fire underneath, or really anything made of fire/lava material. It is kinda slow, but I feel like it is a good compromise for fuel, it makes so much more sense to me. Note that blaze powder will still work, this is just an alternative. The option can be turned off in the config.  \nHeat sources and conductive materials can be specified through the tags `extraalchemy:heat_source` and `extraalchemy:heat_conductor`.\n \n## Vials\n  \n  \nVials are my version of a stackable potion system. Craft a splash potion with an empty vial to get a vial of the potion, or right click an empty vial to fill with the first potion found in your inventory. Vials apply the effect on the player immediately and can be stacked up to 16. To craft an empty vial make the same recipe of a glass bottle in the bottom rows and put a flint in the top-center slot.\n\n## Potion Bag\n\n\nThe potion bag is a handy way to carry around your potions. You can store any drinkable brew inside, and select one type to have quick access to. To access the bag interface shift-right click the bag. Using a simple right click will administer the potion, or it will select the next available type when you run out of the selected one.  \nA keybind can be used while holding a bag to decide what happens when a potion runs out: deselect everything, select next potion, or keep unavailable potion selected.  \nYou can also dye them like leather armor! (They should retain their settings and inventory in doing so, too)\n\n## Potion Rings\n\n\nThe potion rings are a way to have a semi-persistent potion effect. Combine an empty ring with any valid vanilla potion to get the corresponding ring.   \nThis feature can be disabled or configured through the config file.  \nThe ring will apply the potion over time to the wearer, and every available potion is customized to allow different xp costs for more powerful potions.  \nEvery potion also has a customized duration when applied, and XP cost and renewal time can be defined separatedly (aka: no more flashing night vision potion, as the renewal time is at 18s, making the potion go from 36s to 18s, instead of waiting for it to go all the way to 0).  \nNew potions with custom XP cost, level, duration and renewal time can be defined through the vanilla recipe system which is automatically fetched from the server on connection. [Example](https://github.com/zabi94/ExtraAlchemy/tree/1.16-fabric/src/main/resources/data/extraalchemy/recipes/ring_recipes).  \nUsing the same name of a mod-defined json, and setting the output to be a \"useless potion\" (water/awkward/mundane/thick...) will disable that ring.  \nWhen Trinkets is installed, rings will work in the ring slot!\n\n\n## Potion Tooltip Icons\n\nSince 1.18.2 there's the option to see the potion icons on the tooltips of potion-bearing items, like drinking/splash/lingering potions, tipped arrows, vials, potion rings and loaded potion bags:\n\n![potion icon image](https://zabi94.dev/mc_screenshots/tooltip_icons.png)\n\n\n## Bug Support\n  \n1) Install the latest available version for your minecraft version and try again   \n2) If the bug still persist, open a new issue **on Github**  \n\n\n \n## Will you port to...?\n  \n- Past versions: No. Stop asking.\n- Future versions: Sure, on fabric, when I have time. Keep in mind I have a life and a full time job.\n- Forge: No. [Gretchen, stop trying to make Forge happen, it's not going to happen](https://youtu.be/Pubd-spHN-0?t=2). Not even if someone else offers. _I don't want to_ have a forge version.\n\n\n## Currently supported versions:  \n- 1.19.2 and before: No  \n- **1.19.3**: Supported  \n- **1.20 snapshots**: development will begin shortly\n\n\n## Modpack policy\n  \n  \nYou can redistribute the jar **as part of modpacks** if you include a link redirecting to either this page or Curseforge's page.   \n\nDo not redistribute the mod as a single jar, please.\n\nAt the current time, multiple websites are violating this policy, so if you downloaded the mod from them or you visualized their ad-gates, you are actively supporting this practice; please, try to access the files from the original source.  \nJust to mention a few that you should avoid:  \n\n- minecraft-forum.net\n- 9minecraft.net\n- ign.com\n- 8minecraft.com\n- 9minecraft-mods.blogspot.it\n- minecraft-inside.ru\n\n[Read more here!](http://stopmodreposts.org) (You can also download and install a browser plugin from this link, it will help you block malicious sites)\n\n\n\n*Thanks to Vazkii and wiiv for kindly providing the textures for the potion effects, and to she_is_long for reworking all of them (+item textures) to the new Minecraft art style! &lt;3*\n\n ","published":"2021-03-03T07:54:19.305062Z","updated":"2024-01-28T14:32:01.035256Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":70223,"followers":174,"categories":["equipment","magic","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19-rc1","1.19","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["W2XUMxdH","PNmr2iGU","QyXldeI1","CujvY5kV","jDkpjBJZ","k1biqr1E","YkqwMXcq","114GATGr","enpp5Ldu","Z3fyvKQ5","tAu1NVUt","b9ArwEwV","TpwPJBqV","p6wL4IL7","Xc7L1V6F","on6IEEcc","pzSRx3lI","Hp9hpnqj","IHospzO1"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n0S5OkPo/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Z3fyvKQ5","project_id":"n0S5OkPo","author_id":"EJcF9xaL","featured":false,"name":"1.8.1","version_number":"1.8.1","changelog":"- updated to 1.18.2\n- Portuguese translation\n- Potion bag now triggers effects happening when drinking potions, including returning the empty bottle for standard potions\n- Tooltip icons for potion-bearing items","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-04-24T19:08:56.650076Z","downloads":7871,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"c7d184c8c39e603df8361fa5fa79652da1fa1386","sha512":"3c77076d26ee6ae5f8259f9b2898eaef46d673dfd4a7eecc4b5e2653c55475e784dedf522a20afba1bfcce984728f65c07e4980c2ed9b26ad1add38456ca5e1b"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n0S5OkPo/versions/1.8.1/extraalchemy-fabric-1.18.2-1.8.1.jar","filename":"extraalchemy-fabric-1.18.2-1.8.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1176101,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"upq7HCkV","project_id":"t5W7Jfwy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"bGfsSwPy","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"XqLNMi9J","project_id":"5aaWibi9","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"8spxJ5qd","user":{"id":"EJcF9xaL","username":"zabi94","name":"ZaBi94","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/11521878?v=4","bio":"Just a guy having fun coding, to hopefully make a job out of this.","created":"2020-10-19T16:32:22.581413Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"extraalchemy-fabric-1.18.2-1.8.1.jar"},"mods/Botania-1.18.2-435-FABRIC.jar":{"sha512":"596091a7215e206098d2c19ec8a3f9b34195e6b514945bb9f7daae5eec2d6b0a25be6ed1cab36c9cdc1d2f071c5bb5164e6f2a1b0a5a60fdca5364fa988eb1a2","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"pfjLUfGv","slug":"botania","project_type":"mod","team":"ZHXzsq7V","title":"Botania","description":"An innovative natural magic themed tech mod","body":"[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm0.png)](https://violetmoon.org)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm1.png)](https://patreon.com/vazkii)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm2.png)](https://twitter.com/vazkiimods)[![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/vm3.png)](https://discord.gg/vm)\n![](https://violetmoon.org/branding/hero/botania.png)\n\n---\n\n# About\n\nWarning: Botania **Requires [Patchouli](https://modrinth.com/mod/patchouli) and [Curios (Forge)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) or [Trinkets (Fabric/Quilt)](https://modrinth.com/mod/trinkets)!**  \n\n**Botania** is a tech mod themed around natural magic.

Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces. Note that this is an optional feature — Create is not required to run this mod. Be sure to use the latest release of Create for your Minecraft version!

It offers a ton of high quality effects, two default visual style choices, custom effects for almost every block in the game, profiles ranging from Potato to Ultra and it's designed to never be obstructive during gameplay. It started as an edit of BSL Shaders in 2018, and it received countless major updates including a complete rewrite to meet the standards of our community. Complementary Shaders is dedicated to be shaped by user feedback over anything else, and it still receives regular updates to this day.\n\n\"Reimagined\" is one of the two default styles Complementary Shaders r5 comes with. It focuses on preserving the unique visual elements of Minecraft and providing a reworked vanilla feel. [**Learn more about the two styles here.**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#style-section)\n\n<br>\n\n### Sponsored by Ember Host\nCheck out Ember if you are looking for a Minecraft server host that offers exceptional value for price.

The only difference between these two styles is the default settings. The Unbound style is designed for people looking for a more realistic experience, while the Reimagined style is made to reimagine Minecraft while preserving its unique visual elements. Please note that you can still customize everything after your download either style. You can switch to blocky clouds on the Unbound style, or use realistic water on the Reimagined style. All settings are located in Shader Options.\n\n-------------------- [**Unbound Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-unbound) ---------------------------------------- [**Reimagined Style**](https://modrinth.com/shader/complementary-reimagined) --------------------\n\n![Style Comparison](https://www.complementary.dev/assets/img/editedScreenshots/styleComparison-notitle.png)\n\n<br>\n\n### Installation\n**New:** You can just download the [**Complementary Installer**](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/#download-section) and click Install to automatically do all the steps below.\n<br>\n**-** First you need to install either [**OptiFine**](https://optifine.net/downloads) or the [**Iris**](https://irisshaders.net/download) mod to be able to load shaderpacks.

allows you to **specify a config once** and it then **handles reloading values between world loads, syncing values with clients**, and **generating values for client- or server-only** on its own.\n\n---\n\n### Creating a config:\nA config is created using a `ModConfigBuilder`.\nSimply create a new instance using `#ModConfigBuilder()`.\n```java\n   ModConfigBuilder builder = new ModConfigBuilder();\n```\nA value can be added to the config with `ModConfigBuilder#define` which takes a name and a default value.\nFor integer and double values a minimum and maximum value are also required.\n`ModConfigBuilder#define` returns a `Supplier` which should be stored to retrieve the value from the config.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> booleanValue = builder.define( \"booleanValue\", true );\n\n   Supplier<Integer> integerValue = builder.define( \"integerValue\", 5, 0, 10 );\n\n   Supplier<Double> doubleValue = builder.define( \"doubleValue\", 0.5, 0, 1);\n\n   Supplier<ExampleEnum> enumValue = builder.define( \"enumValue\", ExampleEnum.VALUE_1 );\n```\nA comment can be added to a value by calling `ModConfigBuilder#comment(String)` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> valueWithComment = builder.comment( \"this is a comment for 'valueWithComment'\" ).define( \"valueWithComment \", true );\n```\nBy default values are reloaded when world is loaded.\nThis can be changed to only reload a value when Minecraft launches by calling `ModConfigBuilder#gameRestart()` before defining the value.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notReloadedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be reloaded\" ).define( \"notReloadedValue\", true );\n```\nValues in COMMON or SERVER configs are synchronized with clients by default, to prevent this use `ModConfigBuilder#dontSync()`.\n```java\n   Supplier<Boolean> notSynchronizedValue = builder.comment( \"this is value will not be synchronized\" ).define( \"notSynchronizedValue\", true );\n```\nValues can also be put into categories.\n`ModConfigBuilder#push(String)` pushes a category and `ModConfigBuilder#pop()` pops a category.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"special\" );\n   \n   Supplier<Boolean> specialValue = builder.comment( \"this value is in the 'special' category\" ).define( \"specialValue\", true );\n   \n   builder.pop();\n```\nA comment can be added to the active category using `ModConfigBuilder#categoryComment(String)`.\n```java\n   builder.push( \"client\" ).categoryComment( \"this, is a comment for the 'client' category\" );\n```\nAfter defining all values `ModConfigBuilder#build()` must be called to finish the config.\n```java\n   builder.build();\n```\nNow the values in your config will reloaded and synced automatically and the values can be retrieved using the stored `Supplier` instances.\nThis will work for all available versions, that includes Minecraft 1.12, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16, 1.17, 1.18, and 1.19.\n\n---\n\n### Example Mod:\nFor a

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I’m still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8. Can I include Towns and Towers \ninto my modpack?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, but make sure to \ngive credit and a link to our page, and make sure you don't include a modified \nversion of our mod.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>9. 1.16.5???</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Kubek as the original author of Towns and Towers;</li>\n<li>William Wythers, ChoiceTheorem, Apollo, Robified and TelepathicGrunt for \nbeing based;</li>\n<li>Various other creators and their builds for being a massive inspiration \n(check out our Planet Minecraft page\n<a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/\">\nhere</a> for a full list)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any glitches, bugs or have any \nother suggestions, please let us know.

Not only do items stay inside the interface after closing, also some annoying restrictions are removed. Also name tags can be renamed without even using an anvil.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">First of all, anvils now have an <strong>Inventory</strong> for storing the items you put inside. This also means items will stay in the anvil after you close the interface. To put this functionality to good use, anvil contents will now <strong>Render</strong> as laying on top of the anvil.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils no longer use the prior work penalty tag, so no matter how often you repair an item or add new enchantments to it, <strong>Costs Won't Needlessly Increase</strong>. You can also fully <strong>Configure The Max Level Limit</strong>, which controls when the <i>Too Expensive!</i> flag shows up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvils can now be <strong>Repaired</strong> by one stage using iron blocks. You can also use a dispenser to automate repairing.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Name tags have quite a few nice changes: Not only is setting a name in an anvil <strong>Completely Free</strong> and doesn't risk damaging your precious anvil, you don't even need an anvil at all anymore to change a name tag's name. Simply shift + right-click a name tag to <strong>Open A Simple Interface</strong> for setting a new name.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Text Can Be Stylized</strong> using Minecraft's native formatting codes in both the anvil and name tag interface. This allows for setting custom colors and styles when choosing item and entity names. Check the <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Formatting_codes#Usage\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Minecraft Wiki</strong></span></a> for more information on formatting codes.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/27/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/28/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Anvils can be so fancy!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Free name tag renames</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/29/2022-09-29_09.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/503/30/2022-09-29_08.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>No max level limit anymore</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>No anvil required for renaming name tags anymore</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/422/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/424/2022-10-04_21.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Repair anvils by one stage using iron blocks</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>Use formatting codes when naming your equipment</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwTNBWP.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: I want enchanting tables to keep and render their contents as well!</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure thing, check out my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-magic\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Easy Magic</span></a> mod which does just that and more.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Where can I download this mod for Forge on versions of Minecraft before 1.17?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Check out the mods which inspired this project: <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-tweaks\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Tweaks</span></a>, <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/anvil-repair\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Anvil Repair</span></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nametags-without-anvils\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Nametags Without Anvils</span></a> by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/tfarecnim\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>tfarecnim</strong></span></a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for

If one does not, feel free to report it.\n\n## Features\n\n#### Optimizations\n\nA lot of the optimizations in this mod are focused on getting rid of the majority of random lagspikes on servers.\\\nOther than that, it also includes plenty of optimizations for things like chunk ticking, mob spawning, item frames and\nplayer logins.\n\n##\n\n#### Entity Activation Range\n\nA very configurable feature that allows you to drastically cut down on the amount of entities that have to be processed\non the server.\\\nThis is a port based off of Spigot's and PaperMC's implementation, but more configurable with additional (optional) features.\n\n##\n\n#### Dynamic performance checks\n\nAllows the server to automatically adjust the current settings depending on the tick time and config.\\\nThese include: Chunk-tick distance, View distance, Simulation distance & Mobcaps.\n\n##\n\n#### Villager lobotomization\n\nAllows the server to cut down on villager lag from large trading halls, by making villagers stuck inside 1x1 spaces tick less often.\n\n##\n\n#### Breeding Caps\n\nA feature that allows you to set a cap on the amount of mobs of the same type that can be bred within a certain radius.\\\nThis can be useful to prevent players from breeding thousands of animals like chickens or cows in a small area.\n\n##\n\n#### Chunk ticking distance\n\nA setting that allows you to reduce the distance at which chunks can tick (mob spawns & random ticks).\n\\\n\\\n**- And more!**\n\n## Commands, Placeholders and Configuration\n\n### Commands\n<br>\n\n- /servercore settings | config - Allows for modifying settings & configs ingame.\n\n- /servercore status - Gives information about the current dynamic settings.\n\n- /mobcaps - Displays current per-player mobcaps for each spawn group.\n\n- /statistics entities | block-entities - Displays performance related statistics.\n\n##\n\n### Placeholders\n<br>\n\n- `%servercore:view_distance%` - The current view distance.\n- `%servercore:simulation_distance%` - The current simulation distance.\n- `%servercore:chunk_tick_distance%` - The current chunk tick distance.\n- `%servercore:mobcap_percentage%` - The global mobcap percentage that is currently being used.\n\n\n- `%servercore:chunk_count%` - The amount of chunks on the server (doesn't have to be fully loaded).\n- `%servercore:chunk_count loaded%` - The amount of fully loaded chunks on the server (expensive).\n\n\n- `%servercore:entity_count%` - The amount of loaded entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:entity_count nearby%` - The amount of loaded entities nearby.\n\n\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count%` - The amount of ticking block entities on the server.\n- `%servercore:block_entity_count nearby%` - The amount of ticking block entities nearby.\n\n##\n\n### Config\n\nMost features are disabled by default and can be found in the config.\\\nThe config file can be found at `/config/servercore.toml`\n\n```toml\n# Lets you enable /

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2024-01-17T06:38:14.293149Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":905777,"followers":1605,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT","GZoWb3Sj","DqAqkeNx","IvKEtlkS","8iNRv6h2","Gnq4IVE1","EGtndKuU","9GIq2ND0","z5WFPrA6","zdcSsI7C","5VBMcfOB","OsioKrT1","xOy316Zc","Ac9PxwNw","1pzWwAvR","74Yx8tM6","WNdlhpAM","fbZGMUWW","KZVwrmUQ","TbpHIXxk","SS5qaBrE","8oFou220","zGa2nXth","ZnkxeBpm","ZVchszyB","tcrjMnUN","4seBWMhe","u3VqNoAu","c7TDawJ9","4ZslB2Hx","QEQnfRIO","uv7jW0CE","VifrfxZJ","5Pum9sao","r3qto42X","vyuiguoP","hxDtTc1Q","n5YI6Zh6","SH3Z72mF","S9HtDtJv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/5e127e83e3b55e3cebf32e3e8b355296ea62d87d.png"},"version":{"id":"r3qto42X","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 1.2.3","version_number":"1.2.3","changelog":"1.2.3\n\n- added the following animation interpolation methods `easein`,`easeout`,`easeinout`,`cubiceasein`,`cubiceaseout`,`cubiceaseinout`.

All leaves are gone after about one second (configurable). That's it, nothing special about it so far!</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📚 Contents:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: Why another leaf decay mod? Aren't there like a dozen already?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Sure, but this one is different for sure.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Out Of The Box Mod Compat:</strong> All mods that register their leaves in the <code>minecraft:leaves</code> tag are automatically supported, even when their leaves don't extend vanilla Minecraft's leaves block (e.g. some of the large trees in the <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terrestria\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">Terrestria</span></a> mod by <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/coderbot\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">coderbot</span></a>).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>No Additional Block Updates/Block State Checks:</strong> Leaves Be Gone is extremely efficient when determining which leaves blocks to accelerate decay for. It hooks in just where vanilla decides when a leaves block is able to decay, so it doesn't have to do any calculations on it's own. Also no additional calculations are made elsewhere, like when harvesting logs or when other leaves blocks decay as in other mods.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Works Properly Across Chunk/Level Reloads:</strong> Scheduled leaf decays are stored using Minecraft's native system for scheduling ticks (no custom hacky solution required!), so when undloading and reloading the area leaf decay continues as it should without having to repeat any calculations.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>📷 Media:</strong></span></p>\n<table style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/813/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><img src=\"https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/504/814/2022-10-06_11.png\" width=\"410\" height=\"231\" /></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Redwood tree leaves be gone!</strong></td>\n<td>&emsp;&emsp;</td>\n<td><strong>So many drops!</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 20px;\"><strong>💡 FAQ:</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Q: How do I configure this mod?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> Mods can have three different kinds of configs depending on the kind of settings they provide: <strong>Client</strong>, <strong>Common</strong>, and <strong>Server</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Client</strong> and <strong>Common</strong> configs are found in <code>/.minecraft/config/</code>, named as <code>&lt;modId&gt;-client.toml</code> and <code>&lt;modId&gt;-common.toml</code>, respectively.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Server</strong> configs though are applied per world, therefore you'll find those in <code>/.minecraft/saves/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for local singeplayer worlds, and in <code>/&lt;world&gt;/serverconfig/&lt;modId&gt;-server.toml</code> for you Minecraft server. Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9bnOur2.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;

Statistics Screen","description":"A Minecraft mod that improves the statistics screen and makes it more useful.","body":"## Better Statistics Screen\n\nThis Minecraft mod replaces the Vanilla statistics screen with an new and improved statistics screen that is easier to use and that has more helpful features. The new statistics screen features an easier to navigate and read UI layout, as well as a few filters and a search field that will help you find the statictics you need a lot easier, especially when there are dozens, if not hundreds of entries to keep track of.\n\n#### As of v3.0, the mod can optionally be installed on the server side for some extra features:\n\n- Improving the \"betterstats hud\" feature by making it more real-time and more accurate.\n- [v3.2+] The `/statistics` command, which allows you to modify any player's statistics.\n\nKeep in mind that this is optional, and the mod does not have to be installed on the server side in order to work.\n\n### Statistics command syntax help:\n- `/statistics clear <targets>`\n- `/statistics edit <targets> <stat_type> <stat> (set|increase) <value>`\n- [ex. general stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:custom minecraft:jump set 123`\n- [ex. item stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:used minecraft:wooden_shovel set 123`\n- [ex. mob stat]: `/statistics edit @s minecraft:killed minecraft:zombie set 123`\n\n### Requirements (v3.0+)\n- [Installing this mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/n6PXGAoM): Client (Required) ➖ Server (Optional)\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/P7dR8mSH): Client (Required) ➖ Server (Required)\n- [TCDCommons API](https://modrinth.com/mod/Eldc1g37): Client (Embedded aka Optional) ➖ Server (Embedded aka Optional)\n- [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/nfn13YXA): Client (Optional) ➖ Server (Not needed)\n- [Mod menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/mOgUt4GM): Client (Optional) ➖ Server (Not needed)\n\n### Some QnA\n- What about Minecraft Forge?\n    - I have no plans on making future ports to Forge or any other mod loaders. See [GitHub Issue #100](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/issues/100) for more info. However, not all hope is lost! [Sinytra Connector](https://modrinth.com/mod/u58R1TMW) is a mod that lets people run Fabric mods on Forge! Please check it out. Also keep in mind the mod is in beta (as of me writing this), so please don't be harsh towards the mod's developers while expecting the mod to work 100% of the time.\n- Port to older Minecraft versions?\n    - Nope. Same reason as the 'Minecraft Forge' one.\n- I am trying to join a server that has 'betterstats' installed, and I don't want to install it on my end, but 'Fabric API' is forcing me to do so anyway. What do I do?\n    - In my opinion, this is an issue on Fabric API's end, and not mine. Check out my other project called [ISIWIW](https://modrinth.com/mod/GscHM8C5). it's made to tackle this issue. It lets you bypass installation requirements made by servers. So you can use it to bypass having to install certain mods and resource packs.\n- I can't pin stats to the hud. I right-click them, but REI shows up instead. How do I pin stats?\n    - I already put an explanation in the mod, but since you didn't see it, try `L.Shift + Right click`-ing. Aka, just hold down the left shift button while right clicking a stat. That is, if you have REI installed.\n- ✨ Where can I submit my own rating and review for this mod?\n    - I know you didn't ask that question, [but here's the Google Form](https://forms.gle/B1KMvtA5EBQ9yQ4J7). Please feel free to share your thoughts, as I'd love to see them. The form will NOT collect any of your PII.\n\n### A short video (of v1.X)\nHere is a short video showcasing the mod and what it looked like in v1.X (click the image)\n</br></br>\n[![Better Statistics Screen showcase](https://img.youtube.com/vi/AaC8J0G238c/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaC8J0G238c)\n\n### Credits\n#### Video\nI decided to test the mod as well as take screenshots and video footage of the mod in my survival world from the [Better Minecraft](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/better-mc-fabric) mod pack, so as to show how this mod works and that it works with modded features as well. The screenshots and the video footage also feature the [Complementary Shaders](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/customization/complementary-shaders) being used alongside [Iris](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders), as well as the [BYG](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go) mod.\n\n#### Screenshots\nResource packs and shader packs used at the time of screenshotting.\n- [Complementary shaders](https://www.complementary.dev/shaders/)\n- [3D Default](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/5aPp18Lx)\n- [3D crops Revamped](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/PgpTtNoI)\n- [Default Dark Mode](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/6SLU7tS5)\n\nSorry if I missed any. I had too many of them applied at once.","published":"2022-09-02T19:38:08.030776Z","updated":"2024-02-13T10:04:54.248093Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":591613,"followers":1142,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["EnelgdHp","Fk8W9xAv","8RhZhQYw","94aapoJA","4rdXgAx2","uLo8KWrK","SoYOLyoj","WEev32xa","fvo5X8Xj","9eNc6jlA","SAGXYRQW","qgsvDAFG","gz1quzFI","1dR0gD57","307623Pb","F7rjMuqu","WajeE658","H4ve3iC9","oKip6o69","fbwYDHTx","PuyUL15E","wcdeU0Uk","c02NBGoz","YwgivtRx","aMHvwPf2","W7pDuGqC","E1EeTCzR","OFa15O41","QNNqgAdx","nJhfzkvB","GH2n9Xmp","z12xxYRe","823VmOAv","Ufs79Xwx","AKglt1TW","NwsPvqFn","JCedcydw","ytM62cvx","M5IJOqMW","s8PMW1n2","HMC7jXEQ","RM7Dy7vu","9PPcvO4i","UrwGLSJI","LBO8kIEp","DA4J8QTI","zuI0rtcT","oCC1YLFI","5rMFdCwJ","tGhUGisK","sb3SaBaE","QZwSwiZR","18RwTRug","vsM2NrtL","jRrE1yaP","fVJ0IIJU","yebgi9T4","w3dUagqG","8Yswy53a","h7aGFS6n","A6kv9M3f","ng46cYL0","SbiaYJpr","ODcKksFu","cTVirG90","APEn5ML0","eGcQh6sR","VXZAyG4G","dx8kubiy","OQQwqPed","77XYVAe5","5bD14l3I","pQEGz8q4","JwLjCwiB","9Nle6p3Y","XWYy9iPd","saxPMWUK","WNvtlvrR","UPxGVo2j","HZMdcy1s","flzNW6MC","rTAZet3B","S8zvr548","Ah2PN5Vd","TcpdjZq3","TJVb61wk","IRAj3Zja","rCdw3Yao","RanY7iKp","I0YaiUKC","5RoB9ulm","itZVnHEf","yLNRroby","LiBg6GMi","3Dz7ZYBA","WLBCUkWu","uxQfDyI7","UivJDox9","e3q6lD9z","zrhRDvws","rGCv0cOY","qZJRvw7w","1weQYuP0","LyAkMd7b","CdN82lOX","qGf3pduz","KOUA7KHm","E5zqzlew","hsjPjr1l","eZ6vxjVH","CTYD1jrY","hsA6tx3U","2d67uRLI","lwRehylW","9mc9uiOb","PoHesack","qdiBvpLD","cxqQA00g","nRGVPeao","sogTh4cI","cJbr3hAU","KWuKt0ct","1LjgPqG5","71Ie3Fad","25Kl4Bo0","RP77Jp7s"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/n6PXGAoM/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"I0YaiUKC","project_id":"n6PXGAoM","author_id":"j0Ha6a2h","featured":false,"name":"BSS (fabric-1.18.2) - v2.9.3","version_number":"v2.9.3+fabric-1.18.2","changelog":"- Updated Japanese translations thanks to https://github.com/Sw3et-Dre4mer (See [#63](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/pull/63))\n- Updated Russian translations thanks to https://github.com/Rozbiynk (See [#61](https://github.com/TheCSMods/mc-better-stats/pull/61))\n- Removed `Better Stats`'s special `http-client-side` player badges.

To deal full weapon damage against all targets, you need to have Sweeping Edge enchantment.\n### Hold to attack\nHold the attack hotkey to spam attacks on cooldown (configurable).\n### Swing thru grass\nAttack instead of mining zero hardness blocks (configurable).\n### Support any item from any mod (with data files)\nAutomatic compatibility with most mods (weapons without attribute file, will be automatically assigned a matching weapon preset, based on item id).\n\nSuper easy to add dedicated compatibility, support via Discord for partnering modders.\n\n&zwnj;\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔨 Add compatibility to any weapon\n&zwnj;\n\nAdd uniquely created or out of the box behaviour to any weapon from any mod, by just creating **JSON** data files.\n\nCheck out our integration guide [here](https://github.com/ZsoltMolnarrr/BetterCombat#-integrate-your-mod \"integration guide\").\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n&zwnj;\n\n**Client side** settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n**Server side** config can be found at:\n\n- General properties: `config/bettercombat/server.conf`\n\n- Fallback compatibility: `config/bettercombat/fallback_config.conf`\n\nAutomatically created with default values, upon loading any game world for the first time. \n\n&zwnj;\n\n# ⛓ Compatibility\n\n&zwnj;\n\nWith an open source and modular mindset, this project is aiming for maximal compatibility.

own and its only purpose is to act as a dependency for other mods that use its features.\n\n## About\n\nMelody is an OpenAL-based client-side library mod for playing background music.<br>\nIt allows you to use OpenAL in Minecraft separated from Minecraft's sound engine and manager.\n\nMelody allows you to (asynchronously) load audio files from all kinds of sources, including web sources.\n\nIt has built-in support for OGG and WAV audio files, but there's nothing stopping you from extending it to support more file types!\n\nTo get an idea of how to create ready-to-play audio sources, take a look at Melody's [`SimpleAudioFactory`](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody/blob/1.20.1/common/src/main/java/de/keksuccino/melody/resources/audio/SimpleAudioFactory.java) class!\n\nEverything important is documented in the source, so make sure to take a look at [Melody's source on GitHub](https://github.com/Keksuccino/Melody)!\n\n## Copyright & Licensing\n\nMelody Copyright © 2023 Keksuccino.<br>\nMelody is licensed under MIT.\n\n## Server Needed?\n\nYou need a Minecraft server to play with your friends but it's just too much work to setup one on your own?<br>\nNo problem, just rent an ready-to-use server and start playing in a snap!\n\nJust click on the image below and use the code **keksuccino** to get **25% off** your first month!\n\n<a

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2023-12-13T09:52:16.752416Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":2406970,"followers":4417,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"776Z5oW9","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"4.2.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"4.2.1-fabric","changelog":"- Disable threading detector optimizations by default\n  - They cause a very rare and impossible-to-reproduce crash, so enable at your own risk","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-04-24T15:53:26.908674Z","downloads":70081,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d5d047374981d614c2a53422be751dc1491f9cd0","sha512":"066a5644191ee45abde5ad4bf7f1662f8aaef842ed24398e311a35d39861b6159fb55ccd18c6ad8940cabed3341c5163462e7c2895631a6d26945f67db326798"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/4.2.1/ferritecore-4.2.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-4.2.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":119110,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-4.2.1-fabric.jar"},"mods/drippyloadingscreen_fabric_3.0.0_MC_1.18.2.jar":{"sha512":"c4fb984973fbe9f3208dc377d0b9ab14bdb6e8faa78ecbd6562ccfc65ab3da6394fa32a6640b9f3e70a10d95a4af34a58930e5feccf85f08c84ca0ab166b1e5f","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"v3CYg2V9","slug":"drippy-loading-screen","project_type":"mod","team":"4CTo9dV8","title":"Drippy Loading Screen","description":"Addon for FancyMenu to customize the loading screen.","body":"<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://discord.gg/rhayah27GC\"><img src=\"https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/704163135787106365/widget.png?style=banner2\" /></a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/keksuccino\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/132924153-df28357d-6816-48a2-96a8-594333d3b075.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/keksuccino\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/132924155-25fe4269-5936-4cac-88cf-5d6069e0443a.png\" /></a> <a href=\"https://paypal.me/TimSchroeter\"><img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35544624/132924156-ec4300ea-7e10-40de-a271-8effb8fbf5cf.png\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Forge & Fabric\n- [Konkrete](https://modrinth.com/mod/konkrete)\n- [FancyMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/fancymenu)\n\n### Fabric\n- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) (Only for Fabric)\n\n## About \n\nDrippy Loading Screen is a client-side mod to fully customize Minecraft's loading screen (aka. splash screen).\n\nEver wanted a fancier background color?<br>\nSome memes in the loading screen to brighten up the waiting time?<br>\nMaybe a welcome message?<br>\n\nWell, you can do this now!

Advancement Frame, which can be crafted with an Emerald and some Sticks at any time.\n\n- Once placed they will open a GUI where you will be able to select one of your advancement or close the GUI and leave the item empty if desired.\n- When an advancement has been selected the block will display it and will show the advancement name and person who earned it when being looked at.\n- Shift Clicking on it will instead display the advancement description. If the player happens to lose some advancement they will be removed from the plaque the next time the world/chunk is saved.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

[简体中文](https://github.com/xiaocihua/stack-to-nearby-chests/blob/master/README-zh_CN.md)\n\nA client-side ONLY mod, adds the quick stacking and restocking features from Terraria into Minecraft.\n\nThe code to iterate over all nearby containers is from [clientcommands](https://github.com/Earthcomputer/clientcommands) mod.\n\n**Requires Fabric API**\n\n## Features\n- **Press Left Ctrl + s + c to open the mod options screen, configure the mod's appearance, behavior and key mapping**\n\n\n- **Quick stack** If the container contains at least one of an item, move the same item from player inventory into the container.\n- **Restock** Refills the stackable items in player inventory to a full stack using items from the container. \n- The above two operations can be performed using buttons or shortcut keys in the container screen.\nItems that will not be stacked and items that will not be restocked can be specified in the mod options (default: shulker box items).\n\n\n- **Quick stack to nearby containers** Perform Quick Stack on all openable containers within the player's reach.\n- **Restock from nearby containers** Restock with all openable containers within the player's reach.\n- The above two operations can be performed using buttons or shortcut keys in the player inventory screen, \nor using shortcut keys when no screen is open.\nContainers as stacking targets and restocking sources can be specified in the mod options (default: chests, trapped chests, barrels, shulker boxes, ender chests).\n- **Quick stack all items of one type to nearby containers** via shortcut keys or by dragging and dropping items to the \"Quick stack to nearby containers\" button.\n\n- **Favorite items** Hold Left Alt down right-clicking the item to favorite it. Favorite items cannot be Quick Stacked, otherwise behave like normal items.\nThrow with Q key, pick up, quick-move and swap can be disabled separately for favorite items in the mod options. Items will be unfavorited after being removed from the player inventory. \nThis feature is not available in creative mode, switching to creative mode from another mode will clear the flags of all favorite items.\n","published":"2022-10-26T12:59:30.282949Z","updated":"2024-01-08T13:48:40.114840Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":87497,"followers":197,"categories":["storage","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["1JoI68Un","RMtqWBPG","LPtaslBa","z6woAWbJ","8VUlVGAy","H4mD8mrO","HBoGGqOE","RjdRHdb9","ZhZfUEWM","eC46EIHQ","vtwiVRtc","EroNVlxU","d3PMz4aP","lOmMwPIX","l0aVUecs","Nn4hjfzM","XZ3QuG94","NDTyDMOF","WuqfpRUp","1r7K08EX","Wg27fMb5","IpBhnYKV","kI3W5IFx","T1QWHKql","kbXADs2L","CKx8ZfAa","2fjg6Yw8","hJutGAcm","Efmh1Jwm","JZ3Ihnn1","mrfdASC9","eZTLtNPr","s6EKaGwH","xslqqPFc","S0xV3xCx","ooAyHVv7","4zfwhmpM","s9xjTXQ7","JstX0NHW","nO2uqewD","uf7Hc3Q4","LADsEVT8","3fMJ5Ta8","dlkAffS2","1PZIHhGW","m4ecBZx8","mYbjOMGF","dQIIgMpf","HXhdFzdH","7kEW1xad","trUKwUKu"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/HtGckJVc/2390215bab01b0c8a75884f0402208408ed279e7.png"},"version":{"id":"s6EKaGwH","project_id":"HtGckJVc","author_id":"4OFNabuL","featured":true,"name":"0.2.8

installed |\n\n## The GUI\n\nYou can open the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key.\nThis allows you to open the settings, group chats, mute yourself, disable the voice chat, start/stop a recording and hide all icons.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TCCHTl8.png)\n\n### Group Chats\n\nGroup chats allow you to talk to players that are not in your vicinity.\nTo open the group chat interface, either press the group button in the voice chat GUI or just press the `G` key.\n\nTo create a new group, just type a name in the text field and press the button next to it.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/FihRdNd.png)\n\nCreating or joining a group will bring you into the group chat interface.\nYou will also see the heads of the group members in the top left corner of your screen.\nTalking players will be outlined.\nYou can disable these icons by pressing the third button from the left.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZVSfBms.png)\n\nPlayers that are not in a group will see a group icon next to your head, indicating that they can't talk to you.\n\nYou can invite players to your group chat by entering the command `/voicechat invite <playername>`.\n\n### Settings\n\nYou can access the voice chat GUI by pressing the `V` key and pressing the settings button.\n\nThis menu offers the ability to change the general voice chat volume and your microphone amplification.\nIn addition, there is the possibility to specify the recording and playback device.\n\nBy clicking the 'Enable microphone testing' button, you can hear your own voice and adjust the activation level of the voice activation.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/TMyfSYU.png)\n\n## Important Notes\n\nYou need to open a port on the server.

Craft at least 2 Elevator Controllers\n2. Place the first Elevator Controller where you want your elevator\n3. Right-Click on a side of the Elevator Controller that has no buttons\n4. Set your desired platform size and speed\n5. Gather the blocks for your platform\n6. Place the blocks one block lower than the Elevator Controller in front of the side with the buttons\n7. Place the other Elevator Controllers above or below the first one and facing the same direction\n8. Use the middle button to request the platform and the other two to move up or down\n\n<img width='560' src='https://imgur.com/gqYT7rr.gif' alt='Elevator Controller gui'>\n\n#### Adding an Elevator Display\n1. Craft 1 or 2 Elevator Displays\n2. Place the first Elevator Display on top of an Elevator Controller\n3. (Optional) Place the second Elevator Display on top of the first one for an extra tall display\n4. Use the button for the current floor to request the platform and use the other buttons to go to different floors\n\n<img width='310' src='https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/287/891/displays.png' alt='Elevator Controller With Elevator Displays'>\n\n#### Disguising an Elevator Controller or Elevator Display\n1. Hold the block you want to use as a disguise in your hand\n2. Right-Click one of the sides of the Elevator Controller or Elevator Display without buttons\n\n<img width='310' src='https://imgur.com/ZE04KQ6.gif' alt='Disguising an Elevator Controller'>\n\n#### Removing the disguise from an Elevator Controller or Elevator Display\n1. Grab an empty hand\n2. Shift-Right-Click one of the sides of the Elevator Controller or Elevator Display without buttons\n\n#### Changing a floor name\n1. Right-Click one of the sides of the Elevator Controller or Elevator Display without buttons\n2. Enter the desired floor name in the text field\n\n#### Coloring a floor\n1. Hold a dye in your hand\n2. Right-Click the button of a floor on the Elevator Display\n\n<img width='310' src='https://imgur.com/xxzSPqW.gif' alt='Different colored floors'>\n\n#### Binding a Remote Elevator Panel\n1. Hold an Elevator Controller in your hand\n2. Right-Click on an Elevator Controller\n\n<img width='310' src='https://imgur.com/bVaJAON.gif' alt='Binding a Remote Elevator Panel'>   \n   \n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/dxTTsPC.png)\n\n### FAQ\n**My elevator just went through a block, is this normal?**  \nYes, the platform will ignore blocks not at floor level. This is for performance reasons, as checking hundreds of blocks every tick is not a good idea  \n**Is there a limit on the distance between floors?**  \nNo, there is no limit  \n**Does the Elevator Controller consume energy?**  \nNo, the Elevator Controller does not consume energy  \n**Can I use your mod in my modpack?**  \nYes, feel free to use my mod in your modpack\n\n![Separator](https://imgur.com/dxTTsPC.png)\n\n### Discord\nFor future content, upcoming mods, and discussion, feel free to join the SuperMartijn642 discord server!  \n[<img width='400'

You have been warned! <br>\nAlthough if you have problems feel free to leave an issue on the project's GitLab.\n<br> \n \n\n \n## FAQ:\n\n\n**Q: Forge or Fabric?** <br>\nA: Both in the same jar.\n\n**Q: Shaders?** <br>\nA: Some shaders may work with Optifine, however your millage may vary. <br>\nIris needs to add DH support for DH to function with it.\n\n**Q: Does this work with player created structures?** <br>\nA: Yes.\n\n**Q: Is there multiplayer support?** <br>\nA: Yes.\nAlthough currently the mod is only client side so you have to explore chunks for the mod to use them.\n\n<br>\n\n### Extended FAQ:\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/1-general/General\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-general.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/2-problems-and-solutions/Problems-and-Solutions\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-mod-support.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a> <br>\n\n<a href=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/2-frequently-asked-questions/4-mod-support/Mod-Support\">\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/jeseibel/minecraft-lod-mod/-/wikis/_hidden/shared-images/images/faq-button-problem.png\" width=\"200\" />\n</a>\n\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Discord:\nJoin our Discord for news, updates, and help:\ndiscord.com/invite/xAB8G4cENx\n<br> <br>\n\n\n## Support us:\n\nIf you want to help with development, join our discord and let us know!\n\nOtherwise if you can't help with development but still want to support Distant Horizons, check out our donation page:\n\nhttps://ko-fi.com/distanthorizons","published":"2022-01-23T05:46:55.026356Z","updated":"2023-12-04T01:02:59.456232Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":259690,"followers":2431,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["wTtGd14B","DezAJ8u0","x3yEpy5p","ruuHY8OM","2vU5aacx","28PMiKSx","JseXmZpZ","AHJ0mNv1","k5oJ58yR","JV4jiA1y","qLXa9pDD","FnXdZRJ7","z6ZQBfWx","Pn7d9p7i","KrGwvvWA","6ZzUWKxi","KEWnNiUP","8ctYpkCM","QdxhQapq","McgrFayO","ArHY9dmV","38p3qCjb","yEUygWBv","P4psgCf3","xBHpiuwg","qT4v0LBa","QLrBlpYY","mxvQyywi","oYqpZUCe","yqCZe843","f5ukM1Qm","mjIVHovM","zhP09epG","nLshnREE","s3sNOqn2","aOWEQ1nc","r8OABIpt","fAVxiMK6","3yoHVgxZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uCdwusMi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"s3sNOqn2","project_id":"uCdwusMi","author_id":"ksmgF6Gt","featured":true,"name":"2.0.1-a -

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

half an eternity backtracking? Wishing you could just see the whole thing in a more structured format without needing to copy it into external software and back again?*\n\nThis mod intends to address these issues by overhauling the Command Block UI, mainly by extending the single-line command text field into a multi-line text box, complete with vertical and horizontal scrolling as well as automatic parentheses-based indentation! Additionally the large buttons used to cycle the command block type and toggle things like powering mode have been reduced to simple icons with tooltips, and an extra button has been added to switch between displaying the command and the previous output.\n\n![Example](https://i.imgur.com/X3qznq9.png)\n\nThe mod is entirely **clientside**, it takes in the command as received from the server and just displays it across multiple lines and with indentation, but doesn't actually add any line breaks to it.\n\nIt's also fully compatible with [NBT Autocomplete](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nbt-autocomplete), a fantastic mod that I cannot recommend enough for anyone working with commands on the regular!\n\nAnother feature: pressing a configurable keybind ( ; by default) will select one corner of an area based on your current position.

This is the base API that powers some kotlin mods made by fzzyhmstrs (that's me!). Besides offering some basic utility functions that come in handy for many different types of mods, Fzzy Core includes the basic framework of the Modifier System, a flexible and powerful system for modifying... almost anything!\n\n\nFzzy Core has KDoc integrated into the source for guidance on use. I'm also working on creating a wiki!\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Banner](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/85a7141b-76c9-4f0c-bd04-21f4b0d56c4a.webp \"Bisect Hosting Banner\")](https://bisecthosting.com/fzzyhmstrs)\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px;display:table\"> <span> <a href=\"https://discord.gg/Fnw2UbE72x\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"display:inline;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iXATO6K.png\" width=\"265\" height=\"122\"></a> </span> <span> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emi\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img style=\"display:inline;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/U7qHdp4.png\" width=\"288\" height=\"108\"></a> </span> </span> </p>\n\n\n_Fzzy Core is currently for Fabric. No port to Forge is planned at this time._\n\n_Fzzy Core is part of my project to split Amethyst Core into more functional component parts. This mod is the base of those parts, other APIs in my catalog build upon this base (like Amethyst Core for magic mods)_\n\n### Coding Utils\n\nFzzy core contains several utilities that make coding mods just a bit easier! These utilities include:\n\n* A base Enchantment Class that can be easily integrated with a configuration system to disable/enable individual enchantments.\n* A wrapper for Text that avoids headaches involved with multi-version mods and having to constantly battle merge conflicts on Text changes\n* A persistent effect system that allows for creation of delayed, repeating (or non-repeating) events that aren't tied to a specific objects tick or other messy implementation.\n* A particle creation system that allows for placing client-side particles at a certain spot in a players POV. This allows for items with particles dripping off them, a torch that emits smoke, etc.\n\n \n### Synced Configuration System\n\nCreate an easy-to-manage config system that allows for version control over time, and automatically syncs server configs to joining clients!\n\n* Takes advantage of some of Kotlin's unique functionality for a simple and clean looking implementation\n* Helper methods for automatic updating of config files to new versions, capturing the information from the old version before replacing it with the update.\n* Simple implementation of auto-syncing functions.\n\n \n### Custom Flavor Items\n\nAdd basic or tool items with flavortext!\n\n* Default implementation is simply some new lines in the lang file\n* Optional methods for more complex text\n* Also adds description text, for explaining what flavortext means, or for describing item functionality\n\n \n### Mana Items\n\nAdds a simple framework for creating items that use mana instead of being damaged in the typical way.\n\n \n### Modifier Framework\n\nThe Modifier Framework is a flexible and extensible system designed as a parallel to the vanilla Enchanting system. Modifiers aim to solve two of the biggest problems I found with Enchanting: They are easily removable, and they do not internalize their functionality (besides a couple damage methods). Enchantments are also more boring than they could be, displaying their tier with a simple number. Modifiers aim to fix all of those issues!\n\n* Modifiers are designed to be permanent, acting more like affixes. Grindstones can't remove them, for example.\n* Modifiers are designed to internalize their functionality, and can be called as one unit rather than piecemeal.\n* Modifiers act via a \"family tree\" that allow for flavorful tiers. Think of a sword going from \"Rusty\" to \"Shiny\" to \"Gleaming\" etc.\n\n \n\nThe library comes with builtin helper method for displaying modifiers\nAn example tooltip demonstrating modifiers in gold text \n\nSee the wiki link above for more details on these features. Once implemented, a Modifier system can do just about anything. Amethyst Core, for example, has a built-in AugmentModifier that does things from affecting mana cost and cooldown, to changing spell damage or range, to triggering advanced effects like afflicting every mob in a 12 block radius around the caster with Wither upon any successful spell cast.\n\n \n\nModifers can be as simple as a container for passing vanilla AttributeModifiers, or much more complex than the AugmentModifier described above. They could even be used purely for flavor if desired!\n\n \n### Nbt Util\n\nFzzy Core includes a simple util for performing some useful actions on NBT\n\n* read and write BlockPos with a single helper method, instead of manually saving X, Y, Z coords or doing Long conversion\n* Several NbtList utilities for reading from, adding to, and removing from NbtLists\n* An ItemStackId system for attaching a unique identifier to certain itemstacks. This allows, for example, an ItemStack keyed to a specific block entity... or much more!\n* A helper method for transferring non-enchantment NBT from one stack to another.\n\n \n### Raycaster Util\n\nA simple set of helper methods for locating objects\n\n* Server-sided raycasting for detection of game objects without needing to do fancy networking\n* Helper methods for entities, blocks, and locating things in areas around a point (like a player)\n* Ability to check for entities with arbitrarily rotated cuboids. Minecraft's default detection systems all use boxes aligned to the XYZ grid. This is useful for something like checking what enemies a spell hits, even if the player is looking diagonally and up a hill.\n\n \n### Event Registry\n\nRegistry for adding and tracking basic ticking objects not related to specific objects like entities.\n\n* Useful for creating periodic clocks that only fire every X ticks, allowing for creation of tick methods that don't fire every single tick. In fact, the registry comes with a 1 second, 1.5 second, and 2 second interval clock built in.\n* Adds a TickUppable interface and Ticker class for registration of objects to the registry.\n\n \n### Item Model Registry\n\nWant to make a custom trident but can't figure out how in heck to make the in-hand Trident appear like MC's does? This registry is for you!\n\n* Register custom item models for specific render modes (in hand, on ground, etc)\n* Integrates with the standard Fabric BuiltinItemRendererRegistry.DynamicItemRenderer\n\n \n### EffectQueue\n\nHate how adding passive status effects sometimes results in statuses \"fighting\" in the GUI, with statuses rapidly swapping back and forth?\n\n* This simple utility unifies the additions of all status effects passed into it into a predictable order\n* Uses all the standard status effect information you expect with addStatusEffect\n\n \n### Trinket Utils\n\nFzzy Core integrates optionally with Trinkets, adding some utility functions that can be used with them\n\n* getTrinketStacks provides a list of all Tirnkets equipped to the passed living entity\n* the AugmentTasks interface allows for creation of Trinkets that interact with special enchantments call Augments. These augments allow for trinkets with customizable passive and active abilities.","published":"2023-02-03T15:16:31.426932Z","updated":"2024-01-27T18:57:58.208236Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":76308,"followers":27,"categories":["game-mechanics","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["ndIps2V5","b1r9hqit","TyedjopD","jlbK22fV","nXjBTlU8","kA5GUcQN","GUEK1Dqr","o5HyRhRQ","fCsc7KDn","KkoGimcF","xiosgEv7","yqlqLvu8","KmK6eyb1","srGr0kEF","fmbpBARS","SsxOstvS","R0Z86IqQ","w27F4mQN","Pa1sgpF0","cFoQ21i8","VhXzJU5B","sTtZBmX2","KzdbDTuK","gDkoqjEK","98ulVIFp","Okk8QtaS","eKWH3jGK","s2zkvlJ6","eKJOisy1","8VDWk1sx","FAARzWkk","LDtlokNZ","yFyhdjxb","7aws6Qws","TNQO1KHX","iT0usf7m","lUj1i8VZ"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LJ5wlCDr/88d1d3e749b81e988eb3a12b60b259cf516b0bec.png"},"version":{"id":"GUEK1Dqr","project_id":"LJ5wlCDr","author_id":"ANKRvkxl","featured":false,"name":"Fzzy Core 0.1.2+1.18.2","version_number":"0.1.2+1.18.2","changelog":"* Fixed issue where modifiers were not being properly initialized to stacks that should have prior modifiers\n* Added new NBT utility for properly creating a stack with NBT before modifier initialization (needed for resolving point above)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-02-09T23:05:42.754818Z","downloads":358,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"2f85d783125beeb15851047d1045e4b9ba9cb166fe3fe30ebcd48cbc90c5995be2eb389684cce98900a773d53de8a6b6b941b25b60f2725fa063fd8e0633f7a5","sha1":"512e30a2ca551b13a32b5f3a489f685f736eb8b5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LJ5wlCDr/versions/GUEK1Dqr/fzzy_core-0.1.2%2B1.18.2.jar","filename":"fzzy_core-0.1.2+1.18.2.jar","primary":true,"size":256730,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"XqLNMi9J","project_id":"5aaWibi9","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"s10JMAtS","project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"95QMsRyb","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F7zc3ZJZ","user":{"id":"ANKRvkxl","username":"fzzyhmstrs","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/72876796?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-04-13T21:42:13.876320Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fzzy_core-0.1.2+1.18.2.jar"},"mods/player-animation-lib-fabric-1.0.2+1.18.jar":{"sha512":"23825daef84e2f2b6f70d878b9b7af359f712a21f0f1f0cccaa4926e2af97d952832d0a10408269bef9c686fe977b391a74767934fe846f72610ecb49b0a2d49","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"gedNE4y2","slug":"playeranimator","project_type":"mod","team":"f913Xl1r","title":"playerAnimator","description":"animate the player","body":"# Player animation library,  \n## animate the player using keyframes.\n\n\nFor users/modpack devs, just put the jar into the mods folder.  \n\nFor mod developers, you may find more details [here -

This Minecraft mod is written for\nthe Fabric & Quilt mod loaders for modern versions of Minecraft (1.18.2+) - Changes tend to focus on making it more\nextendable, as well as improving compatibility with other mods. Improvements to older features are also being sprinkled\nin from time to time.\n\nThis mod's official project pages can be found below:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod-fabric)\n- [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-restitched) \n\nFabric compatibility *comes first* due to its current adoption in the Minecraft Modding community, however Quilt is\nsupported by the mod currently! In the case that either Mod Loader encounters a problem, make sure to\n[submit a bug report!](https://github.com/squeeglii/grapplemod-restitched)\n\n\n\n## 🔗 Origins\n\nThis repository is an unofficial fork of Yyon's [Grappling Hook Mod](https://github.com/yyon/grapplemod), which was \nwritten to support the Forge mod loader. It has a history stretching back all the way to its MCreator roots in 2015,\nimplementing improved physics, upgrades, and better integrations since.\n\nYou can find the links to its official project pages (and the downloads) here:\n\n- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/grappling-hook-mod/versions)\n- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grappling-hook-mod) (More up-to-date? Last checked 19/6/23)\n\nThis fork's root stems from the 1.19.2 version of v13, created under the original scope of providing an alternative\nunder the Fabric & Quilt ecosystems, as well as updating these ports to future versions.

CTOV adds 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants, each of which is tailored to the terrain, theme, and biome of your Minecraft world.\n\nCTOV will not be backported beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. This means that if you are playing an older version of Minecraft, you will not be able to use CTOV.\n\n<details><summary>FAQs</summary>\n\n1.  **Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**\nYes, it is safe to update CTOV to a newer version. However, if you do experience any problems, please let the mod author know so that they can fix them.\n\n2.  **Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**\nYes, it is safe to add CTOV to an already existing world. However, the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.\n\n3.  **Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**\nCTOV is available for all three mod loaders: Forge, Fabric, and Quilt.\n\n4.  **How can I locate the new structures?**\nTo locate the new structures, you can use the `/locate` command.\n    For 1.18.2, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate ctov:\\[structure\\_from\\_list\\] <br>\n\n    For 1.19+, you would use the following command:\n    >  /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list] <br>\n\n    The `[structure_from_list]` part of the command is the name of the structure that you want to locate. You can find a list of all the available structures in the CTOV documentation.\n\n5.  **Does CTOV modify existing vanilla structures?**\nThe only structures that are modified by CTOV are vanilla villages in older versions. In newer versions, CTOV creates its own structures that are separate from vanilla villages.\n\n6.  **What about the loot of these structures?**\nThe vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility. However, they also use some custom loot tables to integrate said structures into the world better. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but you may also find new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies.\n\n7.  **How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**\nTo report bugs, issues, or suggestions, please go to the CTOV GitHub repo and create an issue. You can also message the mod author on Discord.\n\n8.  **Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**\nYes, you can include CTOV in your modpack. However, please be sure to give credit to the mod author and provide a link to their page.\n\n9.  **Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**\nIf it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Please don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.\n\n10.  **Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**\nThe mod author does not accept commissions or monetary support. They are doing this as a hobby and do not want to be paid for their work.\n\nI hope this answers all of your questions.\n</details>\n\n**![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER4.webp)**\n\n\nChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Village (CTOV) is compatible with most world-generation and structure mods. Full documentation is [here](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility)\n\nIt also works with Guard Villager and other structure packs by ChoiceTheorem.\nMods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs.\n\nHere are some more details about the compatibility of CTOV with other mods:\n\n- **World-generation mods:** CTOV relies on vanilla biome Tags, so almost all world-generation mods like Terralith, Oh Biome You'll Go, and Biomes O'plenty will have appropriate CTOV villages in their biomes.\n- **Structure mods:** Various structure mods like Town&Tower and Repurposed structures also work well with CTOV. However, it is important to exercise caution when using too many mods, as this can cause instability. The same applies to Better Village.\n- **Other mods:** Any other mod that doesn't affect villages and villagers will be compatible by default.\n- Mods that add new villagers will need compatibility packs, which can be found on the CurseForge website.\n\nMod integration\n\nAs a rule of thumb, it's compatible. If it isn't yet, It will be. Read this [wiki page](https://github.com/ChoiceTheorem/ChoiceTheorem-s-overhauled-village/wiki/Compatibility) for details!\n\nYou can suggest more mods in my GitHub Issue section.\n</details>\n\n\n![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/CT_Overhauled_Village/BH_CT_BANNER5.webp)\n\n[![discord-plural](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@intergrav/devins-badges@3/assets/cozy-minimal/social/discord-plural_64h.png)](https://discord.gg/JzYEw7PxQv)

","body":"<p>The Friendly Fire mod will protect your pets and other vulnerable mobs from accidental damage. With this mod installed you will no longer need to worry about your pets jumping in front of your attacks or an accidental missclick with a weapon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why would anyone need this?<br></strong>Many players have issues with accidentally attacking their pets. This often happens during combat where the pet will jump in the way of an enemy. Some players also have issues with missclicking when trying to feed their pets food. For these reasons players often choose to leave their pets behind rather than taking them along on adventures. This mod aims to resolve this in a way that does not make pets unbalanced or overpowered.</p>\n<p><strong>How does it work?<br></strong>After installing this mod pets will be immune to attacks from their owners. Pets will also be immune to damage from pets that have the same owner as them. Additionally baby animals will also be immune to attacks from all sources. If you need to kill a protected mob for some reason simply sneak/crouch while performing the attack. The mod also provides configuration options which can be used to change or disable the types of mobs that are protected.</p>\n<p><strong>Does this work with modded pets?<br></strong>Yes modded pets should work fine. If a modded pet is not protected it is because the mod developer has not defined the entity as an ownable pet in the game code.</p>\n\n<h2>Tags</h2>\n<p>This mod provides several datapack entity tags to help improve the configuration of the mod. Datapacks are a very flexible way to configure the game and allow players, servers, other mods, and modpacks to configure certain properties.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>friendlyfire:bypass_pet - This is an item tag that allows items to bypass pet protections.</li>\n<li>friendlyfire:bypass_all - This is an item tag that allows items to bypass all protections offered by the mod.</li>\n<li>friendlyfire:general_protection - This is an entity tag that allows other mobs to be granted protection from combat damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br>This <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/assets/openloader/FriendlyFire-Villagers-1.0.0.zip\" rel=\"nofollow\">example datapack</a> will add villagers and wandering villagers to the protection list. When working with datapacks it is highly recommended to use a mod like <a href=\"https://www.modrinth.com/mod/open-loader\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open Loader</a> that simplifies the process of installing datapacks.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

Most of them take an optional player argument. If that argument is not given, the target\nof the command will be the command executor.\n\n - `/requiem remnant`\n   - `/requiem remnant set <true|false> [player]`: sets the remnant status of a player. (Remnants are called demons in the lore, they turn into ghosts when they die)\n   - `/requiem remnant query [player]`: queries the remnant status of a player.\n - `/requiem soul`\n   - `/requiem soul set <true|false> [player]`: sets the soul status of a remnant player.\n   - `/requiem soul query [player]`: queries the soul status of a player\n - `/requiem possession`\n   - `/requiem possession start <mob> [player]`: makes the player start possessing a mob, if they are already a soul.\n   - `/requiem possession stop [player]`: stops an ongoing possession on the specified player.\n\nOn top of those commands, Requiem adds a few gamerules to help customize a server's gameplay:\n\n - `requiem:showPossessorNameTag`: if set to `true`, shows the name of the possessor above the head of possessed entities. (default: `false`)\n - `requiem:startingRemnantType`: can be set to `FORCE_REMNANT` or `FORCE_VANILLA` to enforce all players to be respectively a demon or a normal player at the start of the game. (default: `CHOOSE`)\n\n## FAQ\n\n- **Why are mob drops worse when I am possessing something ?** Your prey was killed by a mob, not by a player. To improve your situation, you can try finding a Humanity enchant book in a nether fortress.\n\n- **Why did you choose Fabric to make this mod ?** Simply put, we find Fabric way easier to work with for this kind of project. We will not port the mod to forge ourselves, but will welcome anyone who offers to do so.\n\n- **Why does it not launch ?** Either you forgot to install Fabric API, or Requiem is not yet available for the version you are trying to use. If it's the latter, you can politely inform us in the comments.","published":"2020-12-09T00:13:22.976485Z","updated":"2023-01-01T23:00:14.336236Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":20771,"followers":179,"categories":["adventure","magic"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["KWSVrJ8H","yfa3jOjb","7v8GO1e5","I1uyAGGZ","AD6a3hGl","x1dvmLhi","nRE2cdk3","4nt6VVna","sxB1Vc5x","Ms2LeWgK","fp2CZpeA","WEd46eyG","oZCDygHw","F56wSONy","8TpIdHjv","WBSO7nNX","jXpaxh7T","VOetw2HS","snc182X4","pWZOtaLT","QjGwuL8P","KTrusH13","Y6kPk15q","VDtPRBPy","QT8D9Jip","OnUARVJ2","xAYGab5S","sQs8H47T","JCc1CYSZ","tvTvcOuO","GZVHrR9K","cfSW8ooh","QkAkpk03","ZdYPZ4AR","THWs9cBo","ELTREQ9b","XgUMqLZQ","b4QDhNS1","1RaF5FEO","cjV3SFAX","75X2TtbP","WOGVOLoh","3iSdmV1D","iacSq6RZ","eIjaPOiU","nTX0Gy6U","RxAYKkr7","XBWJt4Le","F8mFPPsd","XG6NG9aX","2aqg5iHj","yiD5DE1y","T7NX3Vk3","CP2qhWyx","UPafOykI","TAqnZwVI"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/bYmqMxlQ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"F8mFPPsd","project_id":"bYmqMxlQ","author_id":"GDgeVWgK","featured":false,"name":"2.0.0-beta.8","version_number":"2.0.0-beta.8","changelog":"Version 2.0.0 -

These can stretch higher than vanilla mountains do, sometimes reaching peaks above y300!\n\n### Underground Rivers\n\nIn mountainous terrain that is too towering to allow regular river generation, terrain gets carved for rivers to continue underground. These link right up to the regular rivers, so there's no interruption in exploring along rivers.  Very deep underground, you can even find a deeper variant with lava instead of water.\n\n### Oceanside Cliffs\n\nOn steep cliff faces in the Stony Shore biome, waves and wind carve into the cliff. (Disclaimer: waves and wind not included.)\n\n### Smoother Surfaces\n\nOne of (if not the most) notable changes to generation you'll see with Tectonic is that terrain is much smoother than normal. This means the strange staircasing on some hills - also referred to as \"lerp\" issues - is gone. In previous Tectonic versions this meant that Windswept biomes were removed from generation, but in v2 and above they will once again generate.\n\n### Dunes\n\nSmooth desert dunes will generate in some Desert biomes, giving Deserts a special look to them.\n\n### Deeper Oceans\n\nOceans are much deeper than they are in vanilla, with deep oceans even extending into the deepslate layer!\n\n-----\n\n### Removed Features\n\nPrevious versions of Tectonic included things like custom biomes, trees, and more. These were removed for both performance and compatibility reasons.

Biomes](https://modrinth.com/mod/not-just-biomes).\n","published":"2022-10-06T04:20:33.396078Z","updated":"2024-01-13T10:57:27.489603Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":267826,"followers":1388,"categories":["adventure","worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w04a","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["eU3jwc8i","etznjsos","FwjITjTl","hnsJhfYa","5GAlwGt0","VrJPesuB","E5XyYJFU","PXOM0Pjv","WHCoQSwq","tv7QYqaD","YpYTfu5q","b9YiEZG5","hexdXndT","LfqeFzal","Sk2Wj54u","jEweyNSr","8DvETEcQ","kyOyZ959","CrJgVhRz","4FmsVRER","o79iZuLn","nCfuFGUJ","kD3ERzAU","YQW6UEha","iXsm0qYv","Xp7KZG02","31L9TtHa","IKoGJPng","VUDM6p8V","ikU2p37z","E1Z5e43T","T8MN0KIq","kBneO6ki","q8U9JFXx","5xZAjOFp","RffiLNDg","sJqpHn8g","iUOBzhHD","VUseyTDe","TROmHrN8","zTGbIDfc","NqBsgux4","9tb4XPoV","xH89dtCn","tx6rLdUA","xmaHuY49","5TxvYf3R","N2QHzPke","65V8fhDb","mBxJOCQy","yqPldUFz","1yngXVi8","9Vv7T6db","RGkQIH1q","rnuM9oqV","xLL0P4rp","VLm89jvQ","gO9d3ZPd","VpCClpZj","jNMP7968","TO90bMp9","gY8cl3L6","y3NXGAQL","8Efuao80","Ojy7D0Vt","xGrrU4rl","H2lfq68F","aZXeWJ3r","clI4wc2M","ZiVAiJjF","i48vQzPC","DRRt4Y5n","ynecO9fz","IFpAp5hn","jQaYKWuK","LhqG2XwP","KnptosY0","FSoTAxFx","wrLFLHwA","r4G2J8jv","v8KY2Bab","MDe9rNGW","IbkUCeqE","auHmdzit"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/lWDHr9jE/9459286c7225ed66c57201881c12e8d1bb8fd2ce.png"},"version":{"id":"IbkUCeqE","project_id":"lWDHr9jE","author_id":"MllXIwZc","featured":false,"name":"Fabric

mods.</p>\n<p><b>For all my mod devs out there - </b>This provides a lot of useful stuff, especially if you're a worldgen modder!</p>\n<p>The API includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>AutoRegistration system (1.18+ only). Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple. I use these for all of my mods!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you're curious, you can check the code for my mods (especially the newer ones) to see how things work.

The best working condition is that you feel nothing when it is operating but smooth and fast rail updates.\n\n## Before you download\n**Please allow me to convey my sincere gratitude towards FX Morin for his code! Most of the code are written by FX Morin and I just do some little adjustment to make it operating.**\n## What's new\n- An update of FX's RailOptimization for 1.16-1.20.4 fabric.\n- Fix the severe crash when loading the mod.\n- Lighter code implementation by removing architectury API.\n\n## Known issue\n- Incompatible with any version of Carpet TIS Addition(CTA).\n\n### Reason\nMethod used to optimize the rail's performance is conflicted with CTA's update mechanism. CTA uses various methods to edit or avoid updates including rail's update(e.g. railDupingFix). Method conflicts will cause some unpredictable failure when injecting mixin and it's truly appeared.\n\n##\n**For more information, please access https://github.com/EasterGhost/RailOptimization**","published":"2023-11-15T07:05:26.168200Z","updated":"2023-12-07T19:13:05.570341Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6847,"followers":24,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["u4jdnaWx","lkFXpXNU","XRdgsYqG","TjzpDwS7","2OEfoI2Z","jXZGYpXo","dZWGhuvi","bWf1xd6D","XuVBWsua","9AQcGopK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QSvN5pBU/842c8ce2d08272f633c3737dd7965dabae23154b.png"},"version":{"id":"TjzpDwS7","project_id":"QSvN5pBU","author_id":"Ub0d0Bah","featured":false,"name":"RailOptimization 1.0","version_number":"1.0","changelog":"support for 1.18.x","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-21T18:20:43.259551Z","downloads":66,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c5cbce93a120ab10015228414c7261cc2c3c5c98d26f5b7a172c4945f799c6e940f7b3658a507f1091bbe998b041fe7388c6c7a368ed786c7ee26951607e84d3","sha1":"e21d9a666dc10dd9329190584df536493e519901"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/QSvN5pBU/versions/TjzpDwS7/RailOptimization-1.18.x-1.0.jar","filename":"RailOptimization-1.18.x-1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":68870,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"5nBMyIsz","user":{"id":"Ub0d0Bah","username":"EasterGhost2","name":"Andrew Elizabeth","avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/Ub0d0Bah/b646cfd313d383ec4d5cce6284d64f0d34520975.jpeg","bio":null,"created":"2023-11-09T16:13:19.848334Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0},{"team_id":"5nBMyIsz","user":{"id":"PdtUuAh6","username":"FX","name":"FX-PR0CESS","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28154542?v=4","bio":"Experienced programmer that can never get a minute of spare time","created":"2021-02-01T21:10:53.315774Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"RailOptimization-1.18.x-1.0.jar"},"mods/MTR-fabric-1.18.2-3.2.2-hotfix-1.jar":{"sha512":"cb9bcaeca40fa872ae6f05d146e00c1480f3601e9a4dbdf39caf6acbe78039a047dbcb7423a6ee94266d646d6924113476c003c76599a3c4e1168df4989d5917","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XKPAmI6u","slug":"minecraft-transit-railway","project_type":"mod","team":"PHYDRKk4","title":"Minecraft Transit Railway","description":"Build your own transport network with automated trains, boats, cable cars, and planes!","body":"# Please Read!

Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2023-12-20T22:19:09.571967Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3367901,"followers":8199,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ALnv7Npy","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium 0.10.3","version_number":"mc1.18.2-0.10.3","changelog":"This release is a backport for 1.18.2.

The dirty cleaning rod can then be washed with a water bucket in a crafting menu.\n\nWeapons that are close to 0 durability will receive a debuff in their performance, further encouraging users to keep them clean.\n\n \n\nThe rifle is similar to a musket but offers greatly increased accuracy thanks to its rifled barrel, this gives it the ability to hit targets at longer distances, this comes at a cost in reload speed and crafting cost.\n\nThe blunderbuss is a primitive shotgun that fires lots of small projectiles at once, extremely devastating at close range (recommend using the no invulnerability tick mod to allow it to reach its full potential), but with very poor performance at longer ranges.\n\n \n\nThere are more features to come, with some of the planned ones including:\nRicochet mechanics for projectiles.\n\nNew assets (3d models and perhaps sounds)\n\nMore powerful weapons, capable of damaging some blocks.","published":"2023-08-19T13:52:22.973347Z","updated":"2023-08-19T13:55:33.112072Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":309,"followers":5,"categories":["equipment"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["jrJzvrEK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MWmvX3Q9/d029c50b45f5872b32dc12c5ec7b1b5e7996c472.png"},"version":{"id":"jrJzvrEK","project_id":"MWmvX3Q9","author_id":"9fxYA1YR","featured":false,"name":"Olden Guns 2.1.0","version_number":"2.1.0","changelog":"2.1.0: added a ricochet mechanic that is fully configurable.","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-08-19T13:55:34.193245Z","downloads":309,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f6a94dcf91dbf3885b4510fdc3b5f5d9a578f7d9","sha512":"15e6a797bfcbe4828a234879a238724526cc8bebcecabaf5f2e52b8a61aabc95810f294c3a1fb175dbdf0dfd418befc18c81fe966af2ba3adca85da6dd2599f8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/MWmvX3Q9/versions/jrJzvrEK/musketmod-1.18.2-fabric-2.1.0.jar","filename":"musketmod-1.18.2-fabric-2.1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":240836,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"egINCmVm","user":{"id":"9fxYA1YR","username":"SirWashington","name":"SirWashington","avatar_url":null,"bio":null,"created":"2023-08-19T13:35:19.057217Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"musketmod-1.18.2-fabric-2.1.0.jar"},"mods/geckolib-fabric-1.18-3.0.80.jar":{"sha512":"1a8e0b6bbf148958827c4f7188d8316da8b82f1f957b778c113b38237660ffb9a1ffdbd59e53267c85cce49737be7da89207cd5ea66dbc2ffd398c29885e11e6","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"8BmcQJ2H","slug":"geckolib","project_type":"mod","team":"XGT1SohE","title":"Geckolib","description":"A 3D animation library for entities, blocks, items, armor, and more!","body":"<center>\n<img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1073846495348019200/1074431979472293999/Image.jpg\" alt=\"logo\"/> \n\n<a href=\"https://discord.gg/sJb8TVjW\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/discord/730912704776110121?color=green&label=Discord&logo=Discord&logoColor=green&style=for-the-badge\" alt=\"discord\"/></a> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/geckosmods\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https://shieldsio-patreon.vercel.app/api?username=geckosmods&type=patrons&style=for-the-badge&color=green&logoColor=green\" alt=\"patreon\"/> </a>\n\n<h1 style=\"font-size:10vw\">GeckoLib is an animation engine for Minecraft Mods, with support for complex 3D keyframe-based animations, 30+ easings, concurrent animation support, sound and particle keyframes, event keyframes, and more.

Installing it on a server won't do anything.**\n\nThis mod allows you to type some emoji/symbols more easily in Minecraft. To be clear, this mod (technically) does not add any emoji to the game, it only makes typing the ones _already in the game_ easier. For this reason, emoji typed will be visible to anyone else on a server and will still be there (on signs, books, etc) if you uninstall the mod. I can not absolutely guarantee all symbols/emoji will work on all servers, some servers have plugins that mess with chat and there is really nothing I can do about that.\n\n### Typing Emojis\nTo type an emoji in chat, simply type a \":\" (colon), after that a list of all possible emoji keywords will appear. Once you type a keyword it will be replaced with the corresponding emoji or symbol. If you want to type an emoji outside of chat (anvil, sign, etc) the list won't appear but the keywords all still work.\n\n### Gallery\n<a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/emoji-type/gallery\">**Images of example mod usage**</a>\n\n### 2.0.0 Update\n- The mod is now fully configurable through Mod Menu and Cloth Config.

Hopefully this will encourage you to farm a little bit of everything!\n\n### **IMPORTANT, BREAKING CHANGES on _1.2.0(MC1.18.2)_ and _1.3.1(MC1.19)_**\n> **This update is a major upgrade, I recommend that you make a backup of your world before updating to this version, because this version modifies identifiers of entities, blocks and items for pantries that have been renamed to cabinet. The mod will try to migrate, but will delete all pantries placed in inventory and world if it does not succeed to migrate.**\n\n## Getting Started\n\n**Follow the advancements!** Much of its progression is described through them. By default, press the (L) key to open the Advancements screen.\n\nIf you'd rather get a more straight-forward guide, we wrote a *__[Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started)__* to help you learn the basics!\n\n\n## Beta Version\n\nThis mod is currently **under development**, so issues and instabilities may occur. If you'd like to play, keep in mind:\n* **Backup your saves often**;\n* Make sure everything is working before adding it to a modpack;\n* Report any issues you find to our **[issue tracker](https://github.com/newhoryzon/farmers-delight-fabric/issues)**! It helps us a lot!\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n***Q. Can I use this mod into my modpack?***\n> Yes! Feel free to feature Farmer's Delight in your modpack, and customize it as you see fit for the experience you're crafting. Just keep in mind:\n> * Make sure to credit, and don't claim Farmer's Delight as your own creation;\n> * Remember that this mod is in beta, so keep and eye out for major gameplay changes and additions that may happen between versions.\n\n***Q. Which Minecraft versions will the mod be updated for?***\n> Farmer's Delight will always keep up with the latest version of Minecraft, with temporary support for the previous one. As of now:\n> * The current focus is exclusively on version(s) : 1.19 and 1.18.2;\n> * This mod port will never be backported to any version prior to 1.16.5 (please don't ask further);\n\n***Q.

Place one down and right click on one to bind yourself, right click to unbind. Nobody else can unbind you from a chat modem\nyou've bound yourself to (apart from breaking and replacing it). Once bound you have access to all the methods:\n\n- `capture`: add a pattern to queue an event every time you send a message that matches. Once a message gets captured,\nit does not get sent to anyone else.\n- `uncapture`: removes a single given pattern or all patterns if none are supplied\n- `getCaptures`: returns a table of all captures\n- `getBoundPlayer`: returns two strings, the username of the bound player, and the UUID of the bound player\n- `say`: sends a message to the bound player.\n\nThe chat modem allows for unlimited distance sending and receiving of messages, with the drawback that it can only bind to one player.\n\n### Creative Chat Modem\n\nThe creative chat modem is similar to a survival modem, with the exception that it applies captures globally.

Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE).

It works on both the client and server, and can be installed on servers without requiring clients to also have the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nWith Phosphor, the amount of time the game takes to generate new chunks can be greatly reduced, and you can expect to see some of the nastier frame stutters caused by loading chunks on the client simply vanish.\n\n<br>\n\nIt's a no-compromises solution for improving performance either in single-player or large multi-player servers, and changes no features or behaviors of the vanilla game. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla behaviours has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required.

These shells are basically new individuals, with their own inventory, experience level, and even gamemode.\n> \\\n> \\\n> However, they lack a mind that would control them. That's where the player comes in. Each shell is biometrically tied to the player whose sample was used to create it, and allows the player to \"sync\" their mind with it, essentially creating multiple player instances.\n\n----\n\n## Crafting recipes\n\n#### Sync Core:\n\n![Sync Core: Daylight Detector + Lapis Block + Daylight Detector + Quartz + Ender Pearl + Quartz + Emerald + Redstone Block + Emerald](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric/raw/1.18.x/stable/media/sync_core-recipe.png)\n\n#### Sync Core (for Hardcore players):\n\n![Sync Core (Hardcore): Daylight Detector + Lapis Block + Daylight Detector + Quartz + Nether Star + Quartz + Emerald + Redstone Block + Emerald](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric/raw/1.18.x/stable/media/sync_core-recipe-hardcore.png)\n\nP.S. - If you aren't brave enough to fight the Wither in Hardcore, you can use [this datapack](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric/raw/1.18.x/stable/media/simplified_hardcore_recipe_datapack.zip) *(it will bring back the original Sync Core recipe)*. Please read [this article](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Installing_a_data_pack), if you don't know how to do it.\n\n#### Shell Constructor:\n\n![Shell Constructor: Gray Concrete + Sync Core + Gray Concrete + Glass Pane + Glass Pane + Glass Pane + Gray Concrete + Redstone + Gray Concrete](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric/raw/1.18.x/stable/media/shell_constructor-recipe.png)\n\n#### Shell Storage:\n\n![Shell Storage: Gray Concrete + Sync Core + Gray Concrete + Glass Pane + Iron Block + Glass Pane + Gray Concrete + Heavy Weighted Pressure Plate + Gray Concrete](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric/raw/1.18.x/stable/media/shell_storage-recipe.png)\n\n#### Treadmill:\n\n![Treadmill: Air + Air + Daylight Detector + Gray Carpet + Gray Carpet + Iron Bars + Gray Concrete + Gray Concrete + Redstone](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric/raw/1.18.x/stable/media/treadmill-recipe.png)\n\n----\n\n## How to play\n\n 1. You need to craft a `shell constructor` and place it down.\n 2. Then you need to provide it with a sample - just `right-click` the thing.  **⚠️WARNING: this action will kill you!** In order to create a shell with full health, the constructor must absorb 20HP *(40 for Hardcore players)*. If you don't want to die, you can eat a golden apple to increase your maximum health, or you can hold a totem of undying during the process *(which is the only option for Hardcore players)*.\n 3. The shell constructor needs power to work, so put a `treadmill` next to it *(it should touch any side of any part of the shell constructor)* and lure a `pig` or a `wolf` to its center to start generating piggawatts.\\\n You should end up with something like this:\n ![Example of working shell constructor](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric/raw/1.18.x/stable/media/shell_constructor-showcase.png)\\\n <sub>You don't really need a comparator, it's here just to demonstrate that you can determine progress of the shell construction process via strength of the comparator output.</sub>\n 4. Once your new shell is constructed, you need to craft a `shell storage` and place it down.\n 5. Supply it with `redstone power`.\n 6. Once doors of the shell storage are open, you can `walk into it`.\n 7. You'll see a radial `menu` that displays your shells:\n ![Menu example](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric/raw/1.18.x/stable/media/menu-showcase.png)\n 8. `Select` the shell you want to transfer your mind into, and enjoy the process!\n\n ## Notes\n\n  - You can color-code shells stored in shell storages. Just right-click a shell storage with dye.\n  - Syncing works cross dimensional, and should support custom dimensions.\n  - If you die while using a shell, you'll be immediately synced with your original body *(if you still have one; otherwise your mind will be transferred to a random shell)*.\n  - Death of a shell doesn't increase your death counter.\n  - Shell can be equipped (or unequipped) with armor, tools, etc. via hoppers connected to a corresponding shell container.\n  - Shell storage should be constantly supplied with power in order to keep stored shell alive.\n    - Shell storage can be powered by redstone, if the `shellStorageAcceptsRedstone` option is set to `true`.\n    - Shell storage can be powered by any valid energy source (e.g., treadmills, machinery from popular tech mods, etc.).\n  - It's possible to measure a shell container's state with a comparator.\n    - You can determine progress of the shell construction process via strength of the comparator output.\n    - You can measure the fullness of a shell's inventory via strength of the comparator output.\n    - You can change a comparator output type by right-clicking on a shell container with a wrench.\n  - Shell storage and shell constructor are pretty fragile, so don't try to mine them without `silk touch` enchantment.\n\n## Config\n\nThe mod is highly configurable. The config is located at `./config/sync.json` and by default looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"enableInstantShellConstruction\": false,\n  \"warnPlayerInsteadOfKilling\": false,\n  \"fingerstickDamage\": 20.0,\n  \"hardcoreFingerstickDamage\": 40.0,\n  \"shellConstructorCapacity\": 256000,\n  \"shellStorageCapacity\": 320,\n  \"shellStorageConsumption\": 16,\n  \"shellStorageAcceptsRedstone\": true,\n  \"shellStorageMaxUnpoweredLifespan\": 20,\n  \"energyMap\": [\n    {\n      \"entityId\": \"minecraft:chicken\",\n      \"outputEnergyQuantity\": 2\n    },\n    {\n      \"entityId\": \"minecraft:pig\",\n      \"outputEnergyQuantity\": 16\n    },\n    {\n      \"entityId\": \"minecraft:player\",\n      \"outputEnergyQuantity\": 20\n    },\n    {\n      \"entityId\": \"minecraft:wolf\",\n      \"outputEnergyQuantity\": 24\n    },\n    {\n      \"entityId\": \"minecraft:creeper\",\n      \"outputEnergyQuantity\": 80\n    },\n    {\n      \"entityId\": \"minecraft:enderman\",\n      \"outputEnergyQuantity\": 160\n    }\n  ],\n  \"syncPriority\": [\n    { \"priority\": \"NATURAL\" }\n  ],\n  \"wrench\": \"minecraft:stick\",\n  \"updateTranslationsAutomatically\": false\n}\n```\n\n| Name | Description | Default value |\n| ---- | ----------- | ------------- |\n| `enableInstantShellConstruction` | If this option is enabled, creative-like shells will be constructed immediately, without the use of energy | `false` |\n| `warnPlayerInsteadOfKilling` | If this option is enabled, a player won't be killed by a shell constructor if they don't have enough health to create a new shell | `false` |\n| `fingerstickDamage` | The amount of damage that a shell constructor will deal to a player when they try to create a new shell | `20.0` |\n| `hardcoreFingerstickDamage` | The amount of damage that a shell constructor will deal to a player in the Hardcore mode when they try to create a new shell | `40.0` |\n| `shellConstructorCapacity` | The amount of energy required to construct a new shell | `256000` |\n| `shellStorageCapacity` | Determines capacity of a shell storage's inner battery | `320` |\n| `shellStorageConsumption` | Energy consumption of a shell storage's life support systems (per tick) | `16` |\n| `shellStorageAcceptsRedstone` | If this option is enabled, a shell storage can be powered by redstone | `true` |\n| `shellStorageMaxUnpoweredLifespan` | Determines how many ticks a shell can survive without a power supply connected to the corresponding shell storage | `20` |\n| `energyMap` | Specifies a list of entities that can produce energy via treadmills | [...](#user-content-config) |\n| `syncPriority` | The order of shell selection for synchronization in case of death <br><br>Available `priority` values:<br><ul><li>`NATURAL` -

shells of the given color are prioritized</li><ul> | `[{ \"priority\": \"NATURAL\" }]` |\n| `wrench` | Identifier of an item that can be used as a wrench in order to change a shell constructor's state | `minecraft:stick` |\n| `updateTranslationsAutomatically` | If this option is enabled, translations will be updated every time the game is launched | `false` |\n\nYou can edit any of these values directly in the config file or via [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n----\n\n## Translations\n\n[![Crowdin](https://badges.crowdin.net/sync-fabric/localized.svg)](https://crowdin.com/project/sync-fabric)\n\n[Sync (Fabric)](https://github.com/Kir-Antipov/sync-fabric) makes use of crowd sourced translations.\n\nYou can help translate the mod to additional languages here: [crowdin.com](https://crowdin.com/project/sync-fabric).\n\n----\n\n## Installation\n\nRequirements:\n -

No more!**\n\nUpgraded backpack can provide about **60 inventory slots** and **2 fluid tanks**, each of which can store up to 6 buckets of fluid or even 24 bottles of potion (Now even more, since it's configurable!). All inventory slots and tanks can be accessed via external pipes. The backpack also provides special buttons - **sort**, **quick stack** and **transfer** to seamlessly manage inventory!\n\n- **Tier Upgrades**\n\nBackpack has to be **upgraded** to reach its maximum storage and tank capacity. Upgrading can be done at a **smithing table** by placing a leather in template slot, higher tier upgrade and a backpack in next slots. Although the backpack can't be directly upgraded to the Netherite tier, it has to be upgraded to all lower tiers first. To reset upgrades, place the backpack on the ground and Shift + Right-click while holding a Blank Upgrade in your hand.\n\n- **Chestplate or backpack? Why not both?**\n\nTraveler's backpack doesn't need any empty armor slot (or other slot, unless Curios integration is enabled) to be worn. The player can wear one backpack on their back at a time and its inventory can be accessed via the **B** (Configurable) button.\n\n- **The best gear for adventures!**\n\nYou are able to use crafting inside the backpack's inventory or pull out the sleeping bag whenever you want! Don't worry, you won't lose your spawn point! Also it's worth taking advantage of handy tool slots (Tool swapping described on Wiki). The fluid tanks, in combination with Hose Item (Hose functioning described on Wiki) provide good portable fluid storage.\n\n- **Customization that you have never seen!**\n\nChoose your personal style from over 45 custom backpacks, which represent various creatures and blocks. As if that weren't enough, some of them can provide special abilities! 1.16+ versions provide **dyed backpack**. You can combine whichever dyes you want to create a unique look!\n\n![end travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/E1YYiRf.png)\n\n## Backpacks and Inventory Preview\n<details>\n<summary>Click</summary>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cRRnmSb.png\" alt=\"all backpacks showcase\" height=\"650\" width = \"584\"/>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XBB0wlj.gif\" width=\"584\" height=\"650\" /></p>\n\n</details>\n\n![bee travelers backpack showcase](https://i.imgur.com/HpldKTS.png)\n\n*** \n\n[<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ufbnlYZ.png\" alt=\"kinetic hosting banner\" width=\"800\" height=\"281\"/>](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=102)\n\n## Modpacks\nYou are allowed to use this mod in public/private modpacks.

In 0.1.0, the villagers require a name in order to be guaranteed converted. In 1.0.0 and beyond, this is configurable. Required on the server for multiplayer, but also works in single player!\n\n### Configuration\n\nYou can configure the behavior of the mod from the `villagerconverting.toml` file within your server (or local instance for single player) config folder. If you're on single player and have ModMenu installed, you can also access the configuration through the UI in ModMenu's mod list!\n\n`modEnabled`: `true|false` - Simple toggle for the mod! When set to `false`, the villagers will fall back to vanilla behavior/probability for zombie-conversion.\n\n`requireName`: `true|false` - When set to `true`, only villagers that have a custom name set (i.e. with a nametag) will be guaranteed to convert! Non-named villagers will fall back to vanilla behavior.","published":"2021-08-21T20:53:39.009900Z","updated":"2024-01-04T22:11:11.112702Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":4051,"followers":59,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["WmDkkP7H","WWY26vIj","H0xcHPF2","zpqwAlOm","KmwGgj9k","iFEL5yMK","VBpwkPlG","WBCltLJU","g48cC5cw","ZnlQJsxj","yCmoPLlY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gtsvJo80/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"zpqwAlOm","project_id":"gtsvJo80","author_id":"leBC4TgK","featured":false,"name":"1.0.1 for 1.18.2","version_number":"1.0.1+1.18.2","changelog":"- Reduced required Fabric loader dependency to no longer require the latest version\n- Fixed issue where mod could sometimes cause Minecraft to crash","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-06-20T18:56:54.163314Z","downloads":170,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"698ad121906fcc483825151779b3928d64a3f364639833a2428346c6b88218babd5e3784cec286de3a7d63f6f722bb28bd455ff8ddd4724de767068f4a73018a","sha1":"dc4faf00973c8902bdb764c3b70c2dc45b1ba6c4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gtsvJo80/versions/1.0.1%2B1.18.2/villagerconverting-1.0.1%2B1.18.2.jar","filename":"villagerconverting-1.0.1+1.18.2.jar","primary":true,"size":340544,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"zuqvYcEf","user":{"id":"leBC4TgK","username":"Roundaround","name":"Evan Steinkerchner","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4167222?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-08-02T19:46:32.785235Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"villagerconverting-1.0.1+1.18.2.jar"},"mods/trinkets-3.3.1.jar":{"sha512":"432fd889b941268a820b418b14d6908d25394b478273ce1b5614fa6a385ca634711a52003dd552839a8adee9e220d71b0ee15a59a3b7edfcb06b35901d36d3d7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"5aaWibi9","slug":"trinkets","project_type":"mod","team":"F0xlmrbH","title":"Trinkets","description":"A data-driven accessory mod","body":"# Trinkets\nA data-driven accessory mod for Minecraft using Fabric.\n\n![Image of the Trinkets UI](https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/images/56224f13887cdd914a9624a18eb845dae0bcdfc0.png)\n\n## About\nTrinkets adds a slot group and slot system to Minecraft. Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter.

(licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-02-06T00:32:19.293889Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2120703,"followers":5133,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"H45YVREb","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.7 for Minecraft 1.18.2/Sodium 0.4.1","version_number":"1.0.7+mc1.18.2","changelog":"- Fix mixin in remapped dev environment\n- Fix AO calculation (PepperCode1)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-08-01T22:28:51.087766Z","downloads":79492,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"cdd32ac79e7cb423af95dbd618c383a9e240e84f53eeb02029f679142e4b980e39c7db8190a2cdb542c23067d56c6b7d29bc21204709028ee5538a659f7cf95f","sha1":"5f5e0910181572f844171ed4f2f11e23f3c68af6"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/1.0.7%2Bmc1.18.2/indium-1.0.7%2Bmc1.18.2.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.7+mc1.18.2.jar","primary":true,"size":118746,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"74Y5Z8fo","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.7+mc1.18.2.jar"},"mods/ShoulderSurfing-Fabric-1.18.2-2.8.1.jar":{"sha512":"f1e485b224c5aea8c0bc966dbf804e6ec221bb548462e1a0f90f09e660d390b8f6b40824ed332f7b61803af5dfe3469290238576f5e66b4b4df8c0f6fb4c19b1","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kepjj2sy","slug":"shoulder-surfing-reloaded","project_type":"mod","team":"rbOXH6PN","title":"Shoulder Surfing Reloaded","description":"Revamped over-the-shoulder F5 third-person camera view","body":"# ShoulderSurfing #\nRevamped over-the-shoulder F5 third-person camera view\n\n# Features #\n\n* Over-the-shoulder camera\n* Hotkeys to move the camera (Default: `arrow keys`, `page up` and `page down`, `O` to swap shoulders)\n* Corrective cross-hair positioning if dynamic crosshair is enabled\n* Hide player if the camera gets too close to it\n* Client-side only\n\n# Installation #\n\n## Forge ##\n\n### Prerequisites ###\n\n1.

Expect less delay in Multiplayer!\n- Added ability to normalize the Vintage Lyre - converting it to a C major key. Enabled by default.\n- Advancement background is now note-block textured\n- ABC layout has been re-introduced\n\n## MIDI\n- The drum now toggles its usage from exlusively left to both left and right. It's just a visual thing, but a nice one imo\n- Minimum MIDI velocity is now 6\n\n## Technical\n- Instrument JSON styler format has been refined. Legacy styler formats are still supported (for now), but are recommended to upgrade.\n- Added model predicate `\"genshinstrument:instrument_open\"`\n- Played hand has been added to the instrument open capability\n- Added various more log messages for debugging\n\n\n# Fixed:\n- Tooltips not showing (1.19.2)\n- Drum note labels not properly saving (Fabric-only)\n- Random crashes upon opening an instrument\n- Lower buttons pannel not centered\n- (API) Instruments with 8 or more rows crashing on note layout\n\n\nAs per all patches since v3.0 (;-;), this is, like, 99% the last update feature update.

","body":"Projector Mod is a client-side mod that adds a custom picture block that can display images from the internet in your Minecraft world.\nProjector Mod works both on the client and the server, when installed as a server-side mod, projector will sync the currently displayed images to all clients.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/1.png)\n\nJoin our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/R2pma3Jfae) for support, suggestions, and feature requests.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo display a picture, you need to create a picture block, currently, this can be done in creative mode by selecting the `Display` item from the `Projector` tab in your inventory. \n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/2.png)\n\nThe size of the displayed picture is controlled by placing picture blocks next to each other. The picture will be scaled to fit the size of the connected blocks. As a minimum, you have to have a single block, as shown in the example below.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/3.png)\n\nBut there is no real limit to the size of picture blocks that you can place.\n\n### Redstone power\nTo display a picture blocks must be redstone powered, at present any signal will do, we plan to add other blocks that integrate with Redstone for example, to change the displayed picture at a later date.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/4.png)\n\n### Configuring Displays\n\nTo set an image to be displayed, you need a remote, you can get this from the `Projector` tab, remotes are linked to a `Display`. \n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/5.png)\n\nTo link a remote and to configure the `Display`, right-click the `bottom left` Display block. You will see the configuration menu.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/6.png)\n\nMultiple images can be added to the Display, you can either use the remote to manually cycle through the images, or you\ncan configure the `Image rotation` duration and set `Auto rotate` to automatically cycle through the images.\n\nIn the previous example, the images would be changed every `3` seconds.\n\nBy default an image is cached indefinitely, this stops Projector from constantly downloading the image from the internet.\nIn certain circumstances you may not want this, for example, you would like to display an image whose URL\ndoes not change but the image is automatically refreshed. In this instance, you can set the `Cache duration` to the\nduration you would like an image to exist for. When `Cache duration` expires the image will be re-downloaded from\nthe internet. \n\n### Switching images\n\nTo cycle through the images in your `Display`, you can use the `Remote`, holding a linked `Remote` in your hand\nand pressing the `Right` mouse button will change the image to the next one in the list. You do not need to\nclick on the `Display` to change images. After all the `Remotes` use Infra-Redstone.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/7.png)\n\n### Templating variables\n\nYou can set environment variables on your server that enable you to automatically set a base URL for an image.\nFor example, if the server has the environment variable `PROJECTOR_base` set to the value `https://mydomain.com`.\nThen in the image URL you can use the template variable `{env.base}` and it will automatically be replaced with the \nvalue of the environment variable.\n\n```shell\n{env.base}/myimage.jpg\n```\n\nOnly environment variables starting with `PROJECTOR_` are read from the server, no other server\nenvironment variable is sent to the client.\n\n### Crafting\nTo create a `Display` in survival mode a recipe must be used consisting of 6 x Oak Planks, 1 x Redstone Dust, and 1 x Glass Block.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/8.png)\n\nTo create a `Remote` in survival mode a recipe must be used consisting of 3 x Oak Planks, 1 x Oak Button, 4 x Iron Ingots, and 1 x Redstone Torch.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HashiCraft/fabric-projector-mod/main/images/9.png)\n\n## Setup\nThis mod requires [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/), the [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api), and minecraft 1.17.1 or later.\n\nTo use the mod you can download the latest jar from the [releases] section of this repository. Copy this to your Minecraft mods folder. If you are planning to use this mod on a server, you will need to copy the jar to the mods folder of your server.\n\n## Shaders\n\nCurrently, Projector works with the current release of [Iris Shaders for Fabric](https://irisshaders.net/).

Overhaul","description":"Introduces a tier system and better effect scaling for beacons.","body":"**A mod for Minecraft that introduces a tier system and better effect scaling for beacons**\n\n- Adds night vision, fire resistance, *nutrition*, *long reach*, and slow falling as beacon effects\n- Adds a tier system for beacons, with diamond and netherite structures providing progressively increased effect potency\n- Adds a higher potency of night vision, allowing the player to see everything with midday lighting (full bright) and no fog effects\n- Adds 2 new effects to the game, Long Reach, increasing interaction reach, and Nutrition, passively restoring food levels\n- Adds a dropping mechanic to slow falling, allowing sneaking to cause a fall at normal velocity whilst still negating damage\n- Adds an increased step height to jump boost, allowing the player to step up blocks instantaneously when the effect is applied\n  - Note: Auto-jump takes precedence, and will need to be disabled for this to have any effect\n\n*In future releases higher potency night vision, long reach, and nutrition may be separated into other mods for modularity.*\n\n![In-game screenshot of

**Description**\nHarvesting crops is such a pain, breaking them all to get the drops and then having to replant each one.  \nWell, not anymore! With this mod you can just right click on your crops to harvest them and leaving a new plant to grow!  \nIt's also compatible with **almost all** modded crops, to ease your mind of one more thing!\n\n***Note:***  \n*Altough it's stated that the mod is required on both sides, it can be safely installed server-side only and still work.*  \n*However when a client that does not have the mod connects to a server that does, and the player tries to harvest a crop while holding a block, it cause block flashing. The only way to prevent this glitch is to set `require hoe` to `true`.*\n\n## **Features**\n- Right-click to harvest any crop, works with both Vanilla and most modded out of the box!  \n  ![Harvesting wheat](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/harvest-with-ease/wheat.gif)\n- Works on nether warts and cocoa beans too!  \n  ![Harvesting cocoa](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/harvest-with-ease/cocoa.gif) ![Harvesting nether wart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/harvest-with-ease/wart.gif)\n- Correctly consumes 1 crop seed to simulate replanting!\n- Right-click while holding an item with fortune to increase drops!\n- **Highly configurable!** See next section for more details.\n\n## **Configuration**\n- **`require hoe`**: whether holding a hoe (either hands) is required to right-click harvest, defaults to `false`.\n- **`damage on harvest`**: how much damage the hoe should receive upon use, effective only if `> 0` and **`require hoe`** is enabled.\n- **`exp on harvest`**: how many experience points should be granted when right-click harvesting or break-harvesting, effective only if `> 0` (note it's exp _points_ and not exp _levels_).\n- **`play sound`**: whether to play a sound when harvesting a crop, defaults to `true`.\n- **`multi-harvest starting tier`**:  \n  Tool tier starting from which it is possible to harvest multiple crops at once.  \n  All tiers that cannot multi-harvest will have a 1x1 square area of effect (a single crop).  \n  If **`starting harvest area size`** is set to `single` and **`area increment step`** to `none` multi-harvest will be effectively disabled, regardless of this config option value.  \n  When set to `none` multi-harvest will be enabled without a tool too. Note that **`require hoe`** takes precedence.\n- **`starting harvest area size`**:  \n  Starting multi-harvest area size (square side length).  \n  The area is always a square centered on the right-clicked crop.  \n  Setting this to `single` and **`area increment step`** to `none` will effectively disable multi-harvest.\n- **`area increment step`**:  \n  Increment step for the harvest area size with higher tool tiers.  \n  Setting this to `none` and **`starting harvest area size`** to `single` will effectively disable multi-harvest.\n- **`crops`**: list of additional in-game IDs for crops that are not supported out of the box, defaults to an empty list.  \n  This last config option is just a safety measure, so far no crop needs it.\n\n## **Dependencies**\n| Mod | Loader | Requirement |\n| :-: | :----: | :---------: |\n| [Forge Config API Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port) | Fabric | Required |\n\n## **License and right of use**\nFeel free to use this mod for any modpack or video, just be sure to give credit and possibly link [here](https://github.com/crystal-nest/harvest-with-ease#readme).  \nThis project is published under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/crystal-nest/harvest-with-ease/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## **For developers**\nYour modded crops will work with this mod out of the box only if they extend the CropBlock class, which is how it should be.  \nIf, for whatever reason, you can't extend that class the **`crops`** config option is there exactly for you. Just add the in-game ID of your crop(s) to make it work, however note that this will work only if your crops have an Integer Property whose name is set to be `\"age\"` and represents the age values your crops can have, from `0` to a `max` value.\n\nSince version 6.0.0.0, an API is available to better integrate your mod with this one. Note however that this should rarely be necessary. To learn how to use the provided API follow the [Wiki](https://github.com/crystal-nest/harvest-with-ease/wiki) on [GitHub](https://github.com/crystal-nest/harvest-with-ease).\n\n## **Support us**\n[![Twitch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/twitch/twitch64.png \"Twitch\")](https://www.twitch.tv/crystal_spider_)\n[![Patreon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/patreon/patreon64.png \"Patreon\")](https://www.patreon.com/crystalspider)\n[![Ko-fi](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/kofi/kofi64.png \"Ko-fi\")](https://ko-fi.com/crystalspider)\n[![GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/github/github64.png \"Our other projects\")](https://github.com/crystal-nest)\n[![Modrinth](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/modrinth/modrinth64.png \"Modrinth\")](https://modrinth.com/user/CrystalSpider)\n[![Curseforge](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/curseforge/curseforge64.png \"Curseforge\")](https://www.curseforge.com/members/crystal_spider_/projects)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/d559b544-474c-4109-b861-1b2e6ca6026a.webp \"Bisect Hosting\")](https://bisecthosting.com/crystalspider)\n","published":"2023-01-13T17:23:47.912576Z","updated":"2024-02-09T15:06:41.098743Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":70741,"followers":129,"categories":["food","game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["c2uAkhIJ","fOxr6O9D","xfHEKm9C","JIL3dgci","QmEjd8ix","Sbre925B","HJ1xFNMH","o3s4MBkn","nkeMMRpw","q4nCjJbA","tjcyUtH4","SgE5JLE4","4FbTqVWZ","pvuv2WDB","oZPIQeda","HF6sIFOg","CI9pX7mQ","Mp4VtKAn","8ROV18ek","HKBKjRCQ","VdQ5nbsV","JuaCeEXy","xbdPqVJa","1Qd1HbgH","5JJJGcdR","Qh3aFrZU","TO7LwLxo","lJpmA82g","11upnhQ1","tsIqko6K","1kZD5Hto","XVLMDksZ","MSx1jdLz","XX6xZK0b","UkYxEa2N","Oi8zlHA9","AA9ObyUZ","nYVd5Cij","4urYhhI9","3U34xKK5","G7Yg2Kj9","jppNJ5i2","ugYe9aHw","sVGyUDbV","ufycy1LY","imFNF4r0","pkS1Se7j","un7QsjpJ","5IZ41JwI","EMtRkcpS","BCg7GMI4","uVzUr5xc","U5EAHEPX","zhKBvBGQ","3819Twv2","nGfcfWHe","XlsUOeRI","EYyGsG6C","pJ5kpXX7","PFZGyyrB","WmbOvfjo","AfvKgd26","OAIikBTR","dvMlHCD9","7QYVeUru","qoWphKZN","MHa8bPQU","LF4MFOAD","TsBAO6VY","vXn3mw48","Fa9y7L4G","jFCbxq53","TFNJlYIt","iQsd1p1b","L4rsCwfo","CsdMEvmE","VmDVcZ4s","l2ENihuM","4os5mZZ7","BiYpGSF3","UnOquKfF","u6HPdski","jDU4TdnA","84uLF3S7","pWFSyLvn","hBAVpE5H","qcVKDMyf","A95oN7hs","N44xmDFK","dOqlzN4s","T1ylYpsZ","vNrBjx7G","bxlJVBn9","3kIBr0dn","JWe8K7qh","niXzZMVX","YNhzABQX","ycjKozip","CMrWRVro","XM7YzeCg","wuPHLwTF","zhIjfCU7","anYrVTgs","eudgBs1m","r19nV2j7","k3IiypQx","zeQzdYG8","kNjn4aNs","n6micWfq","baUnV6Yc","jyfqhnDp","PHRYbmKZ","G7v507bS","1PbzU2TO","wuCXFCyK","9CTdNk3W","YT7ezMrq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/W4Ajthd2/3247a9c9c4e33585271e54b5ec29073b4dcc15f7.png"},"version":{"id":"anYrVTgs","project_id":"W4Ajthd2","author_id":"9xBEY6Nv","featured":false,"name":"[Fabric -

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

to:\n- The annoying \"tutorial\" toasts\n- Recipe unlock toasts\n- \"Messages can't be verified\" on servers with `enforce-secure-profile` off.\n\n### Why does this exist?\n[Methane](https://modrinth.com/mod/methane) from 2.3 onwards has an almost identical toast remover, but since it also has features most people don't want, I decided to release this standalone. Another thing is that all the other \"toast removal\" mods on modrinth don't seem to be maintained, so this is a more \"modern\" alternative.\n\nThe \"main goal\" for this mod is to **always support the latest MC versions,** and has been designed in such a way. **normally this mod will work on later versions of MC than what is listed.**\n\nThis mod also has **zero reliance** on the fabric API, so speedruns _might_ be allowed with this mod. <br> _Ask a moderator if this is allowed first!_\n\nAlso has a neat performance boost because all the logic for presenting and rendering toasts is pretty slow (albeit infrequent after you progress into the late game.)\n\n### How about 🅱orge!??!\n**The Forge port** will be released when Half-Life 3 has released.\n\nAny issues should be reported on github.\n<details>\n<summary> Note for Korean players </summary>\n<p>This mod will inadvertently disable the playtime warnings imposed when playing in Korea, this may require you to have a disclaimer for players, or to maintain a \"korea edition\" without this mod.</p>\n<sub>My korean skills are bad, I can't translate this part confidently. <strong>This is not legal advice.</strong></sub>\n</details>","published":"2023-10-14T23:52:23.792663Z","updated":"2023-10-15T07:08:56.725750Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3130,"followers":18,"categories":["cursed","game-mechanics","optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["yVqxMY32","a8MZ39ac"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/DoJ9HqFj/7dc40d6d5bc8ce42469b8af97af1bccaafea10c2.png"},"version":{"id":"a8MZ39ac","project_id":"DoJ9HqFj","author_id":"BACGcKBJ","featured":false,"name":"The Open Sauce Toast Killer but for every other mc version","version_number":"1.0","changelog":"1.20+ uses `DrawContext` as a rendering system for text.

all surfaces and be physically connected to any solid block no matter the shape.\n- By shift-clicking on a Label with an item you'll be able to change its image, showing that item you selected.\n- Clicking on a Label will let the player interact with the block behind, making it perfect for your storage systems.\n- Images shown by Labels are pixelated and colored to better fit Minecraft style. This works seamlessly for any item.\n- Can accept Glow Ink Sacks to make then glow in the dark.\n- Can be colored with any dye.\n- Using a Feather on them will display the item name.\n- Visuals can he heavily customized with the configs and texture packs.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric.

No longer are your Minecraft builds bound to remain forever static, sitting in the same place for all eternity.\n\n![Eureka! blocks](https://i.imgur.com/DaxvXa9.png)\n\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-downloads allow-modals\" aria-label=\"YouTube Video, Create + Valkyrien Skies drill ship\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LuYnqaVUuQA\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" width=857 height=480></iframe>\n\n<iframe sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms allow-same-origin allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-downloads allow-modals\" aria-label=\"YouTube Video, Eureka!

visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com/partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default.

These can be found in Village Libraries, Stronghold Libraries, and Ruined Portal chests. When you read a Spell Book, you will learn how to cast a spell.\n\nSpell Books contain the Pattern that defines a given Spell.\n\n### Spell Casting:\nCasting Spells requires that you know a given Spell.

Happiness (is a) Warm Gun, or HWG, shoots for (pun intended) a pleasant, interesting-yet-not-overdetailed and simple-yet-in-depth and intuitive gun mod, to add a new class of weapons. HWG also aims for fairly simply models, all made in json, rather than overmodeled and 32x or higher assets, while still giving the player carefully modeled items. In addition, the Overworld is patrolled by gun-toting Illagers, sneaky Illager spies, and the nether is stalked by horrific Technodemons! Time to rip and tea... erm... slash and shoot... until its done.</font></b>\n</br>\n</br>\n<font size=\"10\"><b>Getting Started</font></b>\n<p style=\"font-size:10vw\">First, you will want to gather a good amount of iron, gunpowder, levers, gold nuggets, and similar common ingredients. You should be able to craft a few basic firearms this way with the help of a Gun Table. In addition, weapons may drop from Merc and Spy Illagers.\n\n \n\nHowever, you are only able to craft some of the more basic weapons, try getting a Villager interested in your Gun Table, which will turn them into a Gunsmith. They will offer some stronger and more specific weapons due to their profession.\n\n \n\nHowever, if you still need superior firepower, one must enter the very depths of hell itself. Technodemons dot the burning wastes of the realm, and you may be able to acquire some of their weapons by slaying them.\n\n \n\nAnd finally, a few unique weapons can only be found in loot chests.</p>\n</br>\n</br>\n<font size=\"10\"><b>FAQ</font></b>\n<p><strong>Q: What version is this mod for?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A: HWG is for 1.16.5+ Fabric. Last Minecraft version will be the maintained version.</p>\n \n\n<p><strong>Q: How do I craft guns?</strong></p>\n<p>A: You must first create a Gun Table, then gather a good amount of resources, which will allow you to make some basic firearms and ammo. After that, you can get a Villager interested in your Gun Table to make them take the Gunsmith profession, and many of the more advanced guns can be acquired though trade. However, a few weapons are only mob drops or treasure.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Can I use this mod in a modpack?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A: Go right ahead! Given your modpack follows the usual ToS. I'd also ask you for the pack to be hosted on Curseforge, but I won't stop you if you want to include it in a Technic pack or similar.</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Can I include this mod in a showcase or let's play?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A: Of course! Also, if you do decide to do a review on this mod, please shoot me a link!</p>\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Will you backport/port to Forge?</strong></p>\n\n<p>A: No to both. I would also please ask you to not port this mod to Forge either. In addition, we will not backport to any earlier versions of Fabric.</p>\n\n\n<font size=\"20\"><b>Sponsored by BisectHosting</font></b>\n\nNeed a server to play with friends?

Features\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\n## 🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your

This can be used by mod packs and servers to define custom recipes and other features for a wide range of mods. It can also be used to change textures, override tooltips, and change other aspects of the game.</p>\n\n<h3>Data Packs</h3>\n<p>Data packs are used by Minecraft to load recipes, loot tables, functions, and other game mechanics. Many mods also pull from data packs to handle custom recipe systems and other new mechanics. OpenLoader will load any data packs that are placed in the ~/config/openloader/data folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/data instead. OpenLoader can load zipped and folder packs. You can learn more about data packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Resource Packs</h3>\n<p>Resource packs are used to define textures, translations, sounds, and other client data. You can use them to override existing resources or add completely new ones. These packs are loaded from the ~/config/openloader/resources folder. Before 1.17 they were loaded from ~/openloader/resources instead. OpenLoader can load zipped or unzipped packs.&nbsp;You can learn more about resource packs <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Resource_pack\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>FaQ</h3>\n<p><strong>Does this support mods like Patchouli or BotanyPots?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, packs loaded by this mod will behave exactly like packs loaded through the vanilla systems. So anything that works through the normal resource packs folder or the world datapack folder will work here.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My pack is not loading?</strong></p>\n<p>If your pack is not loading it is because you have not followed the instructions properly or have made an invalid pack. Make sure you have the file placed in the right folder and that your pack has a valid pack.mcmeta file. Unfortunately I do not have the time or resources to help you debug your packs, but there are countless resources and communities available to help you make these things.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How does pack load order work?</strong></p>\n<p>Any resource packs loaded by OpenLoader should be loaded after vanilla and modded resource packs. Data pack load orders are done on a per-world basis instead and can be very annoying. Initially all data packs loaded by this mod will be loaded after vanilla and modded packs. Any mods added to the game after that initial world load will load after all previously loaded packs but only for that world. This can be fixed by using Vanilla's data pack command to correct the world order on a per-world basis. If you need more consistent control over load order I would recommend a scripting tool like <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker\" rel=\"nofollow\">CraftTweaker</a> which is more robust and stable than the data pack system.</p>\n\n<h3>Files</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=forge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Forge</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/open-loader/versions?l=fabric\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fabric</a><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dark-paintings/files/all?filter-status=1&filter-game-version=2020709689:7499\" rel=\"nofollow\"><br></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Like the mod and want to support me?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Pledge on <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/Darkhax\" rel=\"nofollow\">Patreon</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

zoom mod with infinite customizability.*\n\nZoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.\n\n![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will take to zoom in, with a separate setting for zooming out.\n\n### Credits\n- [Xander](https://github.com/isXander) -

This mod now tries to provide similar functionality for Fabric, as\nthe only other Fabric mod with these enchantments that I could find (i.e.\n[BetterShulkers](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-bettershulkers))\nonly supports Minecraft 1.16.\n\n## Features\n\nThis mod adds the \"Siphon\" and \"Refill\" enchantments to the game. They can be\nobtained just like Mending and other treasure enchantments. The enchantments can\nbe added to Shulker Boxes and optionally to Ender Chests (see\n[configuration](#configuration)) on an anvil.\n\n### Siphon\n\nWith the Siphon enchantment, any item that you pick up will be immediately\nstored in an enchanted container as long as that container already has a\nnon-full stack of that exact item inside. The container must be inside your\ninventory.\n\n### Refill\n\nWith the Refill enchantment, any item or item stack you use up will be refilled\nfrom an enchanted container as long as the used stack was held in one of the\nhands (see [configuration](#configuration)). Again, the container must be inside\nyour inventory.\n\n### Vacuum\n\nThe Vacuum enchantment doesn't generate by default making it unobtainable in\nsurvival. To change that, [set the `generateVacuum` option to `true`](#server)\n(and optionally disable Siphon by setting `generateSiphon` to `false`). Its\nbehavior is very similar to that of the Siphon enchantment, with the key\ndifference that it doesn't require the same item to already be present in the\nenchanted container. This means a container enchanted with Vacuum will take all\nitems you pick up as long as it has space to do so.\n\n### Void\n\nSame as [the Vacuum enchantment](#vacuum), the Void enchantment also doesn't\ngenerate by default. To make it obtainable in survival mode,\n[enable the `generateVoid` option](#server). When pick up items of the same type\nas a container with the Void enchantment contains, the picked up items will be\ndeleted. The enchanted container does not require space to put the deleted\nitems, and unlike Siphon, the stacks in the enchanted container can be full.\n\n## A note on Resource Packs\n\nWhen using EnchantedShulkers with a resource pack that alters the look of\nShulker Boxes and/or Ender Chests, the enchanted versions of those items and\nblocks will still use the vanilla texture while closed. This had to be done to\nfix overlapping glint effects on said blocks.\n\nYou can patch your resource pack to include the necessary textures for this mod\nat <https://enchantedshulkers.rubixdev.de>.\n\n## Server/Client\n\nThis mod does actually work as a server-only mod, but it is recommended to be\nused on both client and server. Players without the mod on their client do not\nsee an enchantment glint on enchanted containers.\n\n## I just wanna quickly try 'em out\n\nIf you just want to quickly test the enchantments in a creative world, there are\nmultiple options to do so.\n\n**Option one**: You can search for the enchanted books in the creative inventory\nand apply them with an anvil.\n\n**Option two**: You can give yourself the enchanted books with a command and\napply them with an anvil. Note that the IDs begin with `enchantedshulkers:` and\nnot `minecraft:`.\n\n- Command for Siphon:\n  `/give @s minecraft:enchanted_book{StoredEnchantments:[{id:\"enchantedshulkers:siphon\",lvl:1}]}`\n- Command for Refill:\n  `/give @s minecraft:enchanted_book{StoredEnchantments:[{id:\"enchantedshulkers:refill\",lvl:1}]}`\n\n**Option three**: You can enchant the item you're holding with the `/enchant`\ncommand.\n\n- Command for Siphon: `/enchant @s enchantedshulkers:siphon`\n- Command for Refill: `/enchant @s enchantedshulkers:refill`\n\n## Configuration\n\n### Client\n\nTo configure client side settings, you must have\n[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config) and\n[Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) installed alongside\nEnchantedShulkers. You can then open the settings by opening the mod menu,\nselecting EnchantedShulkers and clicking the settings button on the right side.\n\nThe following options are available:\n\n| **Option**                               | **Default** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ---------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Apply glint to placed containers         | Yes         | Applies the enchantment glint to enchanted shulker boxes and ender chests that are placed in the world                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Prevent glint overlap with custom models | Yes         | Uses different block models and textures for closed containers to prevent overlapping glint.

To do that, create the file `portable_container.json` inside the\n`src/main/resources/data/enchantedshulkers/tags/items/` folder of your mod with\nfollowing contents:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"replace\": false,\n  \"values\": [\"your_mod_namespace:your_container_item\"]\n}\n```\n\nIf your container does not extend the vanilla Shulker Box class, you might have\nto manually implement the\n[`EnchantableBlockEntity`](https://github.com/RubixDev/EnchantedShulkers/blob/1.19/src/main/java/de/rubixdev/enchantedshulkers/EnchantableBlockEntity.java)\ninterface and support rendering the enchantment glint and display name\ncolorizer. For more information have a look at\n[`ShulkerBoxBlockEntityRendererMixin.java`](https://github.com/RubixDev/EnchantedShulkers/blob/1.19/src/main/java/de/rubixdev/enchantedshulkers/mixin/client/ShulkerBoxBlockEntityRendererMixin.java)\nand\n[`ShulkerBoxBlockEntityMixin.java`](https://github.com/RubixDev/EnchantedShulkers/blob/1.19/src/main/java/de/rubixdev/enchantedshulkers/mixin/ShulkerBoxBlockEntityMixin.java).\n\nFor any further questions or issues, please open an issue on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/RubixDev/EnchantedShulkers/issues/new).\n","published":"2022-08-09T08:50:40.728224Z","updated":"2023-12-17T07:13:01.796927Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":49086,"followers":75,"categories":["magic","storage"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["4eRvWZS7","Insnj5AY","YxzKwtBL","jLk0GNdy","7oh79tGp","UEA2nZyd","gXQs0fY0","mOxkhGOv","9Cb04Gex","cqIsAyQO","5jgl1MIj","KRk1bnxM","QxRvomUF","j8YGlTos","9RRoqgwb","BfOwL7wb","dG2rSwWZ","XiXTpl2Z","FRbCuYVK","ll04HPfK","3Ogg5vkg","U8KSJJIL","3SNsyaTx","B1B0eVJf","A7Qs0ZTX","pNpvcXmB","ywil25Ps","3HEK39pS","SrrZmYux","AvxIsuk6","zzATL7AN","4CqP6Sc7","sB0cquxv","hqxFQKZY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vUi6HFie/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"KRk1bnxM","project_id":"vUi6HFie","author_id":"AOZ0TLMS","featured":true,"name":"[1.18.2] EnchantedShulkers v1.0.4","version_number":"1.0.4+1.18.2","changelog":"## Fixes\r\n- Sometimes trying to send packets when networking is not active (fixes #4)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Uses minimum Minecraft version in jar name (i.e. \"1.19\" instead of \"1.19.2\")","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2022-09-05T18:35:45.328350Z","downloads":1170,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d788f94f43ca3be31a08703947dfe4a7ebeebc89","sha512":"78d1392ce12451a481ee747c3695f354b7a0828af4f6540c6088453796514e49a5e8a29054bc79b6ed54c05e89dfc9dfafda43e0d242ebef2ecbde530ab53dfb"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vUi6HFie/versions/KRk1bnxM/enchantedshulkers-1.0.4%2B1.18.2.jar","filename":"enchantedshulkers-1.0.4+1.18.2.jar","primary":true,"size":325439,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"BC3dQECI","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":"nVxObSbX","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"BLMp2TRt","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.18.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"xPnztJSX","user":{"id":"AOZ0TLMS","username":"RubixDev","name":"Silas Groh","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/35602040?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-08-01T15:50:17.003126Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enchantedshulkers-1.0.4+1.18.2.jar"},"mods/chatlagremover-1.0.jar":{"sha512":"b99b5d5e40432549f8cc4ebb10a9bfb9ef45d26dcfaa60c00f3ed07b19e3fd7aa2d23b56597779b8a145d14c19c4ecc674e3186bdb5de2ff9a0e101c7fc669cd","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"M7yaGYtg","slug":"chatlagremover","project_type":"mod","team":"TCRLrFI3","title":"ChatLagRemover","description":"Remove lagging when writing messages.","body":"# ChatLagRemover\nMojang has once again managed to introduce an annoying bug.

The function is mega unnecessary anyway.","published":"2023-01-26T05:58:19.691847Z","updated":"2023-01-26T06:01:37.911090Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2175,"followers":25,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["9TLligoh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/M7yaGYtg/5d01259b95ce2804b5528d07bd60a333d0d11fc0.png"},"version":{"id":"9TLligoh","project_id":"M7yaGYtg","author_id":"vJTKZONy","featured":false,"name":"ChatLagRemover - 1.0","version_number":"1.0","changelog":"init","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-01-26T06:01:38.477637Z","downloads":2175,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"0a805bbd050cd38846723f4aa03f488cb1fda5c1","sha512":"b99b5d5e40432549f8cc4ebb10a9bfb9ef45d26dcfaa60c00f3ed07b19e3fd7aa2d23b56597779b8a145d14c19c4ecc674e3186bdb5de2ff9a0e101c7fc669cd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/M7yaGYtg/versions/9TLligoh/chatlagremover-1.0.jar","filename":"chatlagremover-1.0.jar","primary":true,"size":4850,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"TCRLrFI3","user":{"id":"vJTKZONy","username":"fantahund","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42190420?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-12-14T21:45:43.838575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"chatlagremover-1.0.jar"},"mods/logcleaner-1.0.0.jar":{"sha512":"15fb0be504ba6ff727688fec8e4b654b23d69d515a600512b4549f604bb3ec4550fa17e9bf14a98f9d39de57f3441313e774027e892def2e87287601f16ab1fb","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"hwRo6mwQ","slug":"log-cleaner","project_type":"mod","team":"1zqwIneR","title":"Log Cleaner","description":"A lightweight mod that cleans old, unused log files","body":"A lightweight mod that cleans old, unused log files.\n\nThe best thing is that this mod keeps files not based on creation date, but the most recent access (of any kind) to the file, so logs that are still being accessed for whatever reason are not removed unwillingly.\n\nIt works both client-side only and server-side only, and works in every Minecraft version.\n\nBy default, it will clean logs that haven't been used in more than 14 days, so there's plenty of time in case you ever need them for debugging, but you can configure it to any amount of days you want.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can find the mod's configuration file in `config/logcleaner.json`.

message...\n\n**This mod is the result of thousands of hours of development, and is made possible thanks to players like you.** If you would like to show a token of your appreciation for our work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying us a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n---\n\nSodium is a **free and open-source** mod for Minecraft 1.16+ clients which greatly improves rendering performance while fixing some graphical issues. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n# 📈 Benchmarks\n\nThe following performance comparisons have been contributed by our community, and they show how Sodium can improve frame rates for a wide range of computers, whether fast or slow.

Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.

The others are 1x2, 2x1 and 2x2 block sized.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas (by itself) with right-click lets you view its content.</li>\n<li>Using a palette (by itself) lets you open the palette interface, where you can mix colors to create custom ones.</li>\n<li>Using a canvas in one hand and a palette on the other lets you open both interfaces at once, where you can paint on the canvas using the colors on your palette. You can mix colors here as well.</li>\n<li>Another option is to place the canvas on an easel and right click the easel with a palette at hand.</li>\n<li>The color mixing rules work the same way as the vanilla leather armor dyeing mechanic.</li>\n<li>Change the brush size or opacity with the mouse wheel or by clicking on the GUI element</li>\n<li>Undo mistakes with the CTRL+Z shortcut</li>\n<li>After painting a canvas, you can use it on a wall similar to vanilla paintings to hang it on the wall.</li>\n<li>Hitting the hanged canvas or breaking a block it rests on will drop it back as an item.</li>\n<li>Sign a painting to give it a name and make it unchangeable.</li>\n<li>Copy signed paintings by crafting them together with an empty canvas of the same shape.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Crafting Recipes</h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/Vpf9MsM/canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"159\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7rwQHrr/long-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting long canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"142\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/dByhxvw/tall-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting tall canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"145\" /></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/26jnbYv/large-canvas-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a large canvas\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>To craft a palette, you need at least one kind of dye:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7Xy8959/palette-craft.png\" alt=\"Crafting a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"134\" /></p>\n<p>You can fill an existing palette with other dyes later:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/L8V5BsS/palette-fill.png\" alt=\"Filling a palette\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<p>You can copy signed paintings:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/PW9LKrG/copying-recipe.png\" alt=\"Copying a signed painting\" width=\"400\" height=\"132\" /></p>\n<h5>&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Crafting an easel:</span></h5>\n<h5><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/jWg0Xkx/java-zva-Bwzjr8-A.png\" alt=\"Easel recipe\" width=\"400\" height=\"178\" /></h5>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>Community</h4>\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kAXdzKGXtW\">Discord server</a> now, where you can share your creations with the world!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h4>About shaders:</h4>\n<p>The latest versions (1.18.2, 1.19.2 and above) seem to work fine with custom shaders, but there is no guarantee that it will work with every shader.

Additionally, the dragon no longer spawns from the start - instead, it will be summoned once a player gets close to the bell tower in the center.</p>\n<p>To resummon the dragon, the 4 crystals no longer go right next to the portal. Instead, you'll see 4 bedrock blocks on the floor inside the tower, one in each directional wing of the building. The crystals can be placed on these 4 blocks to start summoning the dragon again. That being said, we do actually still support vanilla crystal summoning positions, to avoid confusing players who aren't familiar with the mod.</p>\n<p>The dragon's AI itself is unchanged.</p>\n<p><b>To use BEI on an existing world,</b> we've provided the <i>/end_island reset</i> command. Using this command while in the End will attempt to reset the dragon fight back to its initial state and replace any previous portal/pillars with our redesigned versions. But this command attempts some major things behind the scenes, so <b>please back up your world before trying!</b> Also note that <b>simply deleting your End dimension files is not suffificient, and you will still need to run the command.</b></p>\n<p>If you're having issues with the portal/tower spawning after using the command, such as the portal spawning under the island, you can use the full command `/end_island reset true` to attempt to place the portal on the surface again. But once again, back up your world before trying it!

They create new Maps in new Dimensions as you'd expect.\n- The mini-map supports the ability to display your current X, Y, & Z coordinates as well as your current Biome\n- **Optional Trinkets support**: \n   - When Trinkets is installed, there will be a new Slot for an Atlas\n   - The Atlas will continue to function as normal inside the Trinkets slot\n\n![navigating_toast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17690401/206922018-2b6195e3-fbe8-4850-bf31-4896764a5747.png)\n\n- The Atlas has a world map view as well. To access this, right-click the Atlas or press \"m\" while the Atlas is on your hot-bar.\n- The world map has selectable tabs for each Dimension you've explored and created Map entries for.\n- It also has selectable tabs for each Banner you've added in each Dimension. Clicking these will snap the center of your view to the map containing the Banner.\n- The world map will display the active X & Z coordinates of the point your mouse is hovering over.\n- The Atlas world view has zoom support & scales by odd numbers 1x1, 3x3, 5x5, 7x7, etc using your mouse scroll wheel.\n- The Atlas world view has full pan support as well, using your mouse to drag the world map.\n- Atlases also support right-clicking Banners to add \"waypoints\", which display in both the mini-map & world-view map.\n\n![sharing_toast](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17690401/206922262-7346a3d7-8c76-4399-9d54-6cfb0f806c6e.png)\n\n- Atlases can also be **merged** with a Cartography Table - simply put an Atlas in the top & bottom slots and the Atlases will combine their mapped regions with one-another!\n- **Atlases also support Lecterns** - Show off your world by putting an Atlas in a Lectern! \n   - Simply right click a Lectern while holding an Atlas to display the Lectern\n   - The Atlas will appear visually different depending on the Dimension its displayed in - there's a unique texture for the Overworld, Nether, End and \"Other\".\n- In Minecraft 1.20+, Atlases can also be put into Chiseled Bookshelves like any other book\n\n## ⚙️ Config\nThe mod is highly configurable and offers in-game config editing with ModMenu. See the current config [options here](https://github.com/Pepperoni-Jabroni/MapAtlases/blob/main/src/main/java/pepjebs/mapatlases/config/MapAtlasesConfig.java)!\n\n## 🔊 Sound Sources\n- [Atlas open sound](https://freesound.org/people/InspectorJ/sounds/416179/), thanks to InspectorJ\n- [Atlas page flip sound](https://freesound.org/people/flag2/sounds/63318/), thanks to flag2\n- [Atlas new map creation sound](https://freesound.org/people/Tomoyo%20Ichijouji/sounds/211247/), thanks to Tomoyo Ichijouji\n\n## ⛓ Dependencies\n- Required:\n   - [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)\n   - [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config)\n- Optional:\n   - [Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)\n   - [Trinkets](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/trinkets)\n\n## ⛔️ Known Incompatiblities\n- [Accurate Maps](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/accurate-maps) (*todo: fix here or submit PR to their project*)\n- [Immersive Portals](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-portals-mod)\n\n## ✅ Recommended Additions\n- [Better Nether Map](https://modrinth.com/mod/better-nether-map) - Makes Nether (& other ceiling dimension) Maps create at y-level of player\n- Cheaper Maps Recipe Data Pack [[1.19]](https://github.com/Pepperoni-Jabroni/MapAtlases/releases/download/2.0.1/cheaper-map-crafting+1.19.zip) - Why would a Map require a Compass? This Data Pack adds a recipe for Empty Maps that's simply 1 Paper + 1 Ink Sac shapeless. \n- Optional \"Modern\" Resource Pack [[1.19]](https://github.com/Pepperoni-Jabroni/MapAtlases/releases/download/2.1.0/map_atlases_modern_resource_pack+1.19.zip) - This Resource Pack gives the Mini-map and World-map a \"modern\" look, abandoning the vanilla Map style textures.\n\n## 📃 Changelog\nChangelogs are available [at the GitHub Releases section](https://github.com/Pepperoni-Jabroni/MapAtlases/releases)\n\n## 📸

src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/mc-1.19.x/stable/readme-assets/whatiscc.png\" alt=\"What is CC:Restitched\" width=\"37.5%\"/>\n\nThis is a port of [cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked) to the [Fabric modloader](https://fabricmc.net/) as well as being a continuation of [JemmaZZ/cc-tweaked-fabric](https://github.com/JemmaZZ/cc-tweaked-fabric) and can be found at [Github Actions](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/actions), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cc-restitched) and [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cc-restitched).\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/mc-1.19.x/stable/readme-assets/ccrandcct.png\" alt=\"CC: Restitched and CC: Tweaked\" width=\"37.5%\"/>\n\nCC: R tries to maintain parity with CC: T, though it may be behind or divergent in some areas. If you notice a disparity please open an issue. CC: R major and minor version numbers indicate parity with the major features of that version of CC: T. Patch version numbers will NOT align.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/mc-1.19.x/stable/readme-assets/incluededpacks.png\" alt=\"Included Resource Packs\" width=\"37.5%\"/>\n\nThis mod includes textures by [Jummit](https://github.com/Jummit) that are more in line with the style of Mojang's new texture-artist, Jappa. If you prefer the original ComputerCraft textures you should  enable the `classic` resource pack.\n We also have a third resourcepack made by [3prm3](https://github.com/3prm3), it features a complete overhaul of CC's textures (in the style of an industrial mod) and can be used by enabling the `overhaul` resource pack. You can also check out his resource pack over [here](https://github.com/cc-orgs/cc-overhaul/tree/main) as  well!<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-orgs/cc-overhaul/main/pack.png\" alt=\"CC: Restitched\" width=\"32\"  height=\"32\"/>\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/mc-1.19.x/stable/readme-assets/bleedingedgever.png\" alt=\"Bleeding Edge Versions\" width=\"37.5%\"/>\n\nBleeding edge builds can be found [here](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/actions) at Github Actions.\nIn the .zip file there should be a `-dev` jar, a `-javadoc` jar, a `-sources-dev` jar, a `-sources` jar, and a \"plain\" jar (jar without an affixed tag) jar.\nPut the \"plain\" jar in the mods folder.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/mc-1.19.x/stable/readme-assets/contributing.png\" alt=\"Contributing to the Repo\" width=\"37.5%\"/>\n\nAny contribution is welcome, be it using the mod, reporting bugs or contributing code. In order to start helping develop CC: R there are a few rules;\n1) Follow the [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) programming guidelines as close as possible. This means you have to use [`loom`](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:mappings) mappings, if you use anything else, your code will be rejected.\n2) Make sure your code follows the checkstyle rules. You can test this by running `./gradle build` or `./gradle check`.\n3) You cannot intentionally implement bugs and security vulnerabilities.\n4) Unless the code is taken directly from CC: Tweaked, `lua` code is offlimits from alteration. If you wish to contribute your changes to the in game rom please contribute upstream at [CC-Tweaked](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/CC-Tweaked).\n5) Branches should be named in this format `mc-<major ver.>.x/<specific-mc-ver.>`\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/mc-1.19.x/stable/readme-assets/renderingmodcompat.png\" alt=\"Rendering Mod Compatibility\" width=\"37.5%\"/>\n\n* [ YES ] [Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sodium)\n* [ YES ] [OptiFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/optifabric)\n\t* Works with VBO Rendering (automatically set)\n\t* No issues\n* [ YES ] [Iris Shaders & Sodium](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/irisshaders)\n* [ YES ] [Canvas](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/canvas-renderer)\n\t* Works with TBO Rendering (Default)\n- ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851534220680495165/960677825185214574/unknown.png)\n\t* Scuffed with VBO Rendering\n\t* <details>\n\t\t<summary>VBO is broken</summary>\n\n  \t\tMonitors are following the player?.\n\t\t- ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851534220680495165/960674312896016394/unknown.png)\n        - ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851534220680495165/960674662839357530/unknown.png)\n\t\t- ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/851534220680495165/960674410510041128/unknown.png)\n\t\t\t* The screen seems to get bigger the closer you get to it.\n\t\t</details>\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/mc-1.19.x/stable/readme-assets/community.png\" alt=\"CC: Restitched\" width=\"37.5%\"/>\n\nIf you need help getting started with CC: Restitched, want to show off your latest project, or just want to chat about ComputerCraft, here is the [Computercraft Forum](https://forums.computercraft.cc/) and the Computer Mods [Discord!](https://discord.gg/H2UyJXe).
