      "Horse breeding in Minecraft can get annoying. Luckily, we have a mod that helps with that. By wearing this monocle on your face, you can see the stats of a horse as long as you are crouching. As a reward, you will be provided with a horse, saddle, and lead in case you spawned in a biome with no horses."
